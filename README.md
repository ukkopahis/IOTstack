Only the ***master***-branch is stable and meant for public use.

# IOTstack

IOTstack is a builder for docker-compose to easily make and maintain IoT stacks on the Raspberry Pi.

### getting started

See [Getting Started](https://sensorsiot.github.io/IOTstack/Getting-Started) in the [IOTstack Wiki](https://sensorsiot.github.io/IOTstack/). It includes:

* A link to Andreas Spiess videos #295 and #352.
* How to download the project (including constraints you need to observe).
* How to migrate from the older gcgarner/IOTstack repository.
* Running the menu to install Docker and set up your containers.
* Useful Docker commands (start \& stop the stack, manage containers).
* Stack maintenance.

### significant change to networking

After 2022-01-18 the menu has changed to use Docker networks differently. Users from before this need to do [migration](https://sensorsiot.github.io/IOTstack/Updates/migration-network-change/) in order to add new services. In essence, just re-select all your services using the menu. If not done, docker-compose will give you an error like:

```
ERROR: Service "influxdb" uses an undefined network "iotstack_nw"
```
