#!/bin/bash

# Usage:
# ./scripts/backup.sh {TYPE=3} {USER=$(whoami)}
#   Types:
#     1 = Backup with Date
#     2 = Rolling Date
#     3 = Both
#   User:
#     This parameter only becomes active if run as root. This script will default to the current logged in user
#       If this parameter is not supplied when run as root, the script will ask for the username as input
#
#   Backups:
#     You can find the backups in the ./backups/ folder. With rolling being in ./backups/rolling/ and date backups in ./backups/backup/
#     Log files can also be found in the ./backups/logs/ directory.
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/backup.sh
#   ./scripts/backup.sh 3
#     Either of these will run both backups.
#
#   ./scripts/backup.sh 2
#     This will only produce a backup in the rollowing folder. It will be called 'backup_XX.tar.gz' where XX is the current day of the week (as an int)
#
#   sudo bash ./scripts/backup.sh 2 pi
#     This will only produce a backup in the rollowing folder and change all the permissions to the 'pi' user.
