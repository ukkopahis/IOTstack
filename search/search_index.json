The Raspberry Pi Zero W2 has been tested with IOTstack. It works but the 512MB RAM means you should not try to run too many containers concurrently. Users have also reported success on Orange Pi Win/Plus. Most services will run on any Linux machine with Docker, but some have Raspberry Pi specific default configurations or dependencies. Your Raspberry Pi has a reasonably-recent version of 32-bit or 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (aka \"Raspbian\") installed. You can download operating-system images: Current release : \"Raspberry Pi OS with desktop\" is recommended. Prior releases : This offers only \"Raspberry Pi OS with desktop\" images. You've done a \"default\" Raspberry Pi OS install, which automatically satisfies: you log in as a regular user, not root. The actual username and its numeric uid doesn't matter. this user has sudo -access, usually this is done by belonging to the sudo -group. boot partition is mounted at /boot . Your operating system has been updated: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y For brevity, this documentation also makes some guesses, but these aren't technical requirements. If you have a different choice, you'll just have to adjust the commands presented in these instructions to match the change. For first-time Linux users it's recommended to start with these: You are logged-in as the user \"pi\". The home directory for user \"pi\" is /home/pi/ . IOTstack is installed at ~/IOTstack (with that exact spelling). The system hostname is raspberrypi New installation \u00b6 automatic (recommended) \u00b6 Install curl : $ sudo apt install -y curl Run the following command: $ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack/master/install.sh | bash Run the menu and choose your containers: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d manual \u00b6 Install git : $ sudo apt install -y git Clone IOTstack: If you want \"new menu\": $ git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack If you prefer \"old menu\": $ git clone -b old-menu https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack Run the menu and choose your containers: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Note: If you are running \"old menu\" for the first time, you will be guided to \"Install Docker\". That will end in a reboot, after which you should re-enter the menu and choose your containers. Bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d scripted \u00b6 If you prefer to automate your installations using scripts, see PiBuilder . Required system patches \u00b6 Unless you know what you are doing, assume these are needed. patch 1 \u2013 restrict DHCP \u00b6 Run the following commands: $ sudo bash -c '[ $(egrep -c \"^allowinterfaces eth\\*,wlan\\*\" /etc/dhcpcd.conf) -eq 0 ] && echo \"allowinterfaces eth*,wlan*\" >> /etc/dhcpcd.conf' See Issue 219 and Issue 253 for more information. patch 2 \u2013 update libseccomp2 \u00b6 This patch is ONLY for Raspbian Buster. Do NOT install this patch if you are running Raspbian Bullseye. check your OS release Run the following command: $ grep \"PRETTY_NAME\" /etc/os-release PRETTY_NAME=\"Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)\" If you see the word \"buster\", proceed to step 2. Otherwise, skip this patch. if you are indeed running \"buster\" Without this patch on Buster, Docker images will fail if: the image is based on Alpine and the image's maintainer updates to Alpine 3.13 ; and/or an image's maintainer updates to a library that depends on 64-bit values for Unix epoch time (the so-called Y2038 problem). To install the patch: $ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138 $ echo \"deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free\" | sudo tee -a \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list\" $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install libseccomp2 -t buster-backports patch 3 - kernel control groups \u00b6 Kernel control groups need to be enabled in order to monitor container specific usage. This makes commands like docker stats fully work. Also needed for full monitoring of docker resource usage by the telegraf container. Enable by running (takes effect after reboot): $ echo $( cat /boot/cmdline.txt ) cgroup_memory = 1 cgroup_enable = memory | sudo tee /boot/cmdline.txt $ sudo reboot the IOTstack menu \u00b6 The menu is used to install Docker and then build the docker-compose.yml file which is necessary for starting the stack. The menu is only an aid. It is a good idea to learn the docker and docker-compose commands if you plan on using Docker in the long run. menu item: Install Docker (old menu only) \u00b6 Please do not try to install docker and docker-compose via sudo apt install . There's more to it than that. Docker needs to be installed by menu.sh . The menu will prompt you to install docker if it detects that docker is not already installed. You can manually install it from within the Native Installs menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Native Installs\" Select \"Install Docker and Docker-Compose\" Follow the prompts. The process finishes by asking you to reboot. Do that! Note: New menu (master branch) automates this step. menu item: Build Stack \u00b6 docker-compose uses a docker-compose.yml file to configure all your services. The docker-compose.yml file is created by the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Build Stack\" Follow the on-screen prompts and select the containers you need. The best advice we can give is \"start small\". Limit yourself to the core containers you actually need (eg Mosquitto, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana, Portainer). You can always add more containers later. Some users have gone overboard with their initial selections and have run into what seem to be Raspberry Pi OS limitations. Key point: If you are running \"new menu\" (master branch) and you select Node-RED, you must press the right-arrow and choose at least one add-on node. If you skip this step, Node-RED will not build properly. Old menu forces you to choose add-on nodes for Node-RED. The process finishes by asking you to bring up the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d The first time you run up the stack docker will download all the images from DockerHub. How long this takes will depend on how many containers you selected and the speed of your internet connection. Some containers also need to be built locally. Node-RED is an example. Depending on the Node-RED nodes you select, building the image can also take a very long time. This is especially true if you select the SQLite node. Be patient (and ignore the huge number of warnings). menu item: Docker commands \u00b6 The commands in this menu execute shell scripts in the root of the project. other menu items \u00b6 The old and new menus differ in the options they offer. You should come back and explore them once your stack is built and running. switching menus \u00b6 At the time of writing, IOTstack supports three menus: \"Old Menu\" on the old-menu branch. This was inherited from gcgarner/IOTstack . \"New Menu\" on the master branch. This is the current menu. \"New New Menu\" on the experimental branch. This is under development. With a few precautions, you can switch between git branches as much as you like without breaking anything. The basic check you should perform is: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git status Check the results to see if any files are marked as \"modified\". For example: modified: .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile Key point: Files marked \"untracked\" do not matter. You only need to check for \"modified\" files because those have the potential to stop you from switching branches cleanly. The way to avoid potential problems is to move any modified files to one side and restore the unmodified original. For example: $ mv .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile.save $ git checkout -- .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile When git status reports no more \"modified\" files, it is safe to switch your branch. current menu (master branch) \u00b6 $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout master $ ./menu.sh old menu (old-menu branch) \u00b6 $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout old-menu $ ./menu.sh experimental branch \u00b6 Switch to the experimental branch to try the latest and greatest features. $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout experimental $ ./menu.sh Notes: Please make sure you have a good backup before you start. The experimental branch may be broken, or may break your setup. Please report any issues. Remember: you can switch git branches as much as you like without breaking anything. simply launching the menu (any version) won't change anything providing you exit before letting the menu complete. running the menu to completion will change your docker-compose.yml and supporting structures in ~/IOTstack/services . running docker-compose up -d will change your running containers. The way back is to take down your stack, restore a backup, and bring up your stack again. useful commands: docker & docker-compose \u00b6 Handy rules: docker commands can be executed from anywhere, but docker-compose commands need to be executed from within ~/IOTstack starting your IOTstack \u00b6 To start the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Once the stack has been brought up, it will stay up until you take it down. This includes shutdowns and reboots of your Raspberry Pi. If you do not want the stack to start automatically after a reboot, you need to stop the stack before you issue the reboot command. logging journald errors \u00b6 If you get docker logging error like: Cannot create container for service [service name here]: unknown log opt 'max-file' for journald log driver Run the command: $ sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json change: \"log-driver\" : \"journald\" , to: \"log-driver\" : \"json-file\" , Logging limits were added to prevent Docker using up lots of RAM if log2ram is enabled, or SD cards being filled with log data and degraded from unnecessary IO. See Docker Logging configurations You can also turn logging off or set it to use another option for any service by using the IOTstack docker-compose-override.yml file mentioned at IOTstack/Custom . starting an individual container \u00b6 To start a particular container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb stopping your IOTstack \u00b6 Stopping aka \"downing\" the stack stops and deletes all containers, and removes the internal network: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down To stop the stack without removing containers, run: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop stopping an individual container \u00b6 stop can also be used to stop individual containers, like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop \u00abcontainer\u00bb This puts the container in a kind of suspended animation. You can resume the container with $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose start \u00abcontainer\u00bb There is no equivalent of down for a single container. It needs: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v \u00abcontainer\u00bb To reactivate a container which has been stopped and removed: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb checking container status \u00b6 You can check the status of containers with: $ docker ps or $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose ps viewing container logs \u00b6 You can inspect the logs of most containers like this: $ docker logs \u00abcontainer\u00bb for example: $ docker logs nodered You can also follow a container's log as new entries are added by using the -f flag: $ docker logs -f nodered Terminate with a Control+C. Note that restarting a container will also terminate a followed log. restarting a container \u00b6 You can restart a container in several ways: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart \u00abcontainer\u00bb This kind of restart is the least-powerful form of restart. A good way to think of it is \"the container is only restarted, it is not rebuilt\". If you change a docker-compose.yml setting for a container and/or an environment variable file referenced by docker-compose.yml then a restart is usually not enough to bring the change into effect. You need to make docker-compose notice the change: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb This type of \"restart\" rebuilds the container. Alternatively, to force a container to rebuild (without changing either docker-compose.yml or an environment variable file): $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate \u00abcontainer\u00bb See also updating images built from Dockerfiles if you need to force docker-compose to notice a change to a Dockerfile. persistent data \u00b6 Docker allows a container's designer to map folders inside a container to a folder on your disk (SD, SSD, HD). This is done with the \"volumes\" key in docker-compose.yml . Consider the following snippet for Node-RED: volumes : - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data You read this as two paths, separated by a colon. The: external path is ./volumes/nodered/data internal path is /data In this context, the leading \".\" means \"the folder containing docker-compose.yml \", so the external path is actually: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data This type of volume is a bind-mount , where the container's internal path is directly linked to the external path. All file-system operations, reads and writes, are mapped to directly to the files and folders at the external path. deleting persistent data \u00b6 If you need a \"clean slate\" for a container, you can delete its volumes. Using InfluxDB as an example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v influxdb $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb $ docker-compose up -d influxdb When docker-compose tries to bring up InfluxDB, it will notice this volume mapping in docker-compose.yml : volumes : - ./volumes/influxdb/data:/var/lib/influxdb and check to see whether ./volumes/influxdb/data is present. Finding it not there, it does the equivalent of: $ sudo mkdir -p ./volumes/influxdb/data When InfluxDB starts, it sees that the folder on right-hand-side of the volumes mapping ( /var/lib/influxdb ) is empty and initialises new databases. This is how most containers behave. There are exceptions so it's always a good idea to keep a backup. stack maintenance \u00b6 Breaking update Recent changes will require manual steps or you may get an error like: ERROR: Service \"influxdb\" uses an undefined network \"iotstack_nw\" update Raspberry Pi OS \u00b6 You should keep your Raspberry Pi up-to-date. Despite the word \"container\" suggesting that containers are fully self-contained, they sometimes depend on operating system components (\"WireGuard\" is an example). $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y git pull \u00b6 Although the menu will generally do this for you, it does not hurt to keep your local copy of the IOTstack repository in sync with the master version on GitHub. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git pull container image updates \u00b6 There are two kinds of images used in IOTstack: Those not built using Dockerfiles (the majority) Those built using Dockerfiles (special cases) A Dockerfile is a set of instructions designed to customise an image before it is instantiated to become a running container. The easiest way to work out which type of image you are looking at is to inspect the container's service definition in your docker-compose.yml file. If the service definition contains the: image: keyword then the image is not built using a Dockerfile. build: keyword then the image is built using a Dockerfile. updating images not built from Dockerfiles \u00b6 If new versions of this type of image become available on DockerHub, your local IOTstack copies can be updated by a pull command: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune The pull downloads any new images. It does this without disrupting the running stack. The up -d notices any newly-downloaded images, builds new containers, and swaps old-for-new. There is barely any downtime for affected containers. updating images built from Dockerfiles \u00b6 Containers built using Dockerfiles have a two-step process: A base image is downloaded from from DockerHub; and then The Dockerfile \"runs\" to build a local image. Node-RED is a good example of a container built from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile defines some (or possibly all) of your add-on nodes, such as those needed for InfluxDB or Tasmota. There are two separate update situations that you need to consider: If your Dockerfile changes; or If a newer base image appears on DockerHub Node-RED also provides a good example of why your Dockerfile might change: if you decide to add or remove add-on nodes. Note: You can also add nodes to Node-RED using Manage Palette. when Dockerfile changes ( local image only) \u00b6 When your Dockerfile changes, you need to rebuild like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker system prune This only rebuilds the local image and, even then, only if docker-compose senses a material change to the Dockerfile. If you are trying to force the inclusion of a later version of an add-on node, you need to treat it like a DockerHub update . Key point: The base image is not affected by this type of update. Note: You can also use this type of build if you get an error after modifying Node-RED's environment: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d nodered when DockerHub updates ( base and local images) \u00b6 When a newer version of the base image appears on DockerHub, you need to rebuild like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker system prune $ docker system prune This causes DockerHub to be checked for the later version of the base image, downloading it as needed. Then, the Dockerfile is run to produce a new local image. The Dockerfile run happens even if a new base image was not downloaded in the previous step. deleting unused images \u00b6 As your system evolves and new images come down from DockerHub, you may find that more disk space is being occupied than you expected. Try running: $ docker system prune This recovers anything no longer in use. Sometimes multiple prune commands are needed (eg the first removes an old local image, the second removes the old base image). If you add a container via menu.sh and later remove it (either manually or via menu.sh ), the associated images(s) will probably persist. You can check which images are installed via: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE influxdb latest 1361b14bf545 5 days ago 264MB grafana/grafana latest b9dfd6bb8484 13 days ago 149MB iotstack_nodered latest 21d5a6b7b57b 2 weeks ago 540MB portainer/portainer-ce latest 5526251cc61f 5 weeks ago 163MB eclipse-mosquitto latest 4af162db6b4c 6 weeks ago 8.65MB nodered/node-red latest fa3bc6f20464 2 months ago 376MB portainer/portainer latest dbf28ba50432 2 months ago 62.5MB Both \"Portainer CE\" and \"Portainer\" are in that list. Assuming \"Portainer\" is no longer in use, it can be removed by using either its repository name or its Image ID. In other words, the following two commands are synonyms: $ docker rmi portainer/portainer $ docker rmi dbf28ba50432 In general, you can use the repository name to remove an image but the Image ID is sometimes needed. The most common situation where you are likely to need the Image ID is after an image has been updated on DockerHub and pulled down to your Raspberry Pi. You will find two containers with the same name. One will be tagged \"latest\" (the running version) while the other will be tagged \"\\<none>\" (the prior version). You use the Image ID to resolve the ambiguity. pinning to specific versions \u00b6 See container image updates to understand how to tell the difference between images that are used \"as is\" from DockerHub versus those that are built from local Dockerfiles. Note: You should always visit an image's DockerHub page before pinning to a specific version. This is the only way to be certain that you are choosing the appropriate version suffix. To pin an image to a specific version: If the image comes straight from DockerHub, you apply the pin in docker-compose.yml . For example, to pin Grafana to version 7.5.7, you change: grafana : container_name : grafana image : grafana/grafana:latest \u2026 to: grafana : container_name : grafana image : grafana/grafana:7.5.7 \u2026 To apply the change, \"up\" the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d grafana If the image is built using a local Dockerfile, you apply the pin in the Dockerfile. For example, to pin Mosquitto to version 1.6.15, edit ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile to change: # Download base image FROM eclipse-mosquitto:latest \u2026 to: # Download base image FROM eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.15 \u2026 To apply the change, \"up\" the container and pass the --build flag: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build mosquitto","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Basic_setup/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"Basic_setup/#requirements","text":"IOTstack makes the following assumptions: Your hardware is a Raspberry Pi (typically a 3B+ or 4B).

For example: modified: .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile Key point: Files marked \"untracked\" do not matter. You only need to check for \"modified\" files because those have the potential to stop you from switching branches cleanly. The way to avoid potential problems is to move any modified files to one side and restore the unmodified original. For example: $ mv .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile.save $ git checkout -- .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile When git status reports no more \"modified\" files, it is safe to switch your branch.","title":"switching menus"},{"location":"Basic_setup/#current-menu-master-branch","text":"$ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout master $ ./menu.sh","title":"current menu (master branch)"},{"location":"Basic_setup/#old-menu-old-menu-branch","text":"$ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout old-menu $ ./menu.sh","title":"old menu (old-menu branch)"},{"location":"Basic_setup/#experimental-branch","text":"Switch to the experimental branch to try the latest and greatest features. $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout experimental $ ./menu.sh Notes: Please make sure you have a good backup before you start.

To pin an image to a specific version: If the image comes straight from DockerHub, you apply the pin in docker-compose.yml .

From time to time the IP address that your ISP assigns changes and it's difficult to keep up. Fortunately, there is a solution: Dynamic DNS. The section below shows you how to set up an easy-to-remember domain name that follows your public IP address no matter when it changes. Secondly, how do you get into your home network? Your router has a firewall that is designed to keep the rest of the internet out of your network to protect you. The solution to that is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or \"tunnel\". Dynamic DNS \u00b6 There are two parts to a Dynamic DNS service: You have to register with a Dynamic DNS service provider and obtain a domain name that is not already taken by someone else. Something on your side of the network needs to propagate updates so that your chosen domain name remains in sync with your router's dynamically-allocated public IP address. Register with a Dynamic DNS service provider \u00b6 The first part is fairly simple and there are quite a few Dynamic DNS service providers including: DuckDNS.org NoIP.com You can find more service providers by Googling \"Dynamic DNS service\" . Some router vendors also provide their own built-in Dynamic DNS capabilities for registered customers so it's a good idea to check your router's capabilities before you plough ahead. Dynamic DNS propagation \u00b6 The \"something\" on your side of the network propagating WAN IP address changes can be either: your router; or a \"behind the router\" technique, typically a periodic job running on the same Raspberry Pi that is hosting IOTstack and WireGuard. If you have the choice, your router is to be preferred. That's because your router is usually the only device in your network that actually knows when its WAN IP address changes. A Dynamic DNS client running on your router will propagate changes immediately and will only transmit updates when necessary. More importantly, it will persist through network interruptions or Dynamic DNS service provider outages until it receives an acknowledgement that the update has been accepted. Nevertheless, your router may not support the Dynamic DNS service provider you wish to use, or may come with constraints that you find unsatisfactory so any behind-the-router technique is always a viable option, providing you understand its limitations. A behind-the-router technique usually relies on sending updates according to a schedule. An example is a cron job that runs every five minutes. That means any router WAN IP address changes won't be propagated until the next scheduled update. In the event of network interruptions or service provider outages, it may take close to ten minutes before everything is back in sync. Moreover, given that WAN IP address changes are infrequent events, most scheduled updates will be sending information unnecessarily. DuckDNS container \u00b6 The recommended and easiest solution is to install the Duckdns docker-container from the menu. It includes the cron service and logs are handled by Docker. For configuration see Containers/Duck DNS . Note This is a recently added container, please don't hesitate to report any possible faults to Discord or as Github issues. DuckDNS client script \u00b6 Info This method will soon be deprecated in favor of the DuckDNS container. IOTstack provides a solution for DuckDNS. The best approach to running it is: $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin $ cp ~/IOTstack/duck/duck.sh ~/.local/bin The reason for recommending that you make a copy of duck.sh is because the \"original\" is under Git control. If you change the \"original\", Git will keep telling you that the file has changed and it may block incoming updates from GitHub. Then edit ~/.local/bin/duck.sh to add your DuckDNS domain name(s) and token: DOMAINS = \"YOURS.duckdns.org\" DUCKDNS_TOKEN = \"YOUR_DUCKDNS_TOKEN\" For example: DOMAINS = \"downunda.duckdns.org\" DUCKDNS_TOKEN = \"8a38f294-b5b6-4249-b244-936e997c6c02\" Note: The DOMAINS= variable can be simplified to just \"YOURS\", with the .duckdns.org portion implied, as in: DOMAINS = \"downunda\" Once your credentials are in place, test the result by running: $ ~/.local/bin/duck.sh ddd, dd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss \u00b1zzzz - updating DuckDNS OK The timestamp is produced by the duck.sh script. The expected responses from the DuckDNS service are: \"OK\" - indicating success; or \"KO\" - indicating failure. Check your work if you get \"KO\" or any other errors. Next, assuming dig is installed on your Raspberry Pi ( sudo apt install dnsutils ), you can test propagation by sending a directed query to a DuckDNS name server. For example, assuming the domain name you registered was downunda.duckdns.org , you would query like this: $ dig @ns1.duckdns.org downunda.duckdns.org +short The expected result is the IP address of your router's WAN interface. It is a good idea to confirm that it is the same as you get from whatismyipaddress.com . A null result indicates failure so check your work. Remember, the Domain Name System is a distributed database. It takes time for changes to propagate. The response you get from directing a query to ns1.duckdns.org may not be the same as the response you get from any other DNS server. You often have to wait until cached records expire and a recursive query reaches the authoritative DuckDNS name-servers.

When launched in the background by cron , the script supplied with IOTstack adds a random delay of up to one minute to try to reduce the \"hammering effect\" of a large number of users updating DuckDNS simultaneously. Standard output and standard error are redirected to /dev/null which is appropriate in this instance. When DuckDNS is working correctly (which is most of the time), the only output from the curl command is \"OK\". Logging that every five minutes would add wear and tear to SD cards for no real benefit. If you suspect DuckDNS is misbehaving, you can run the duck.sh command from a terminal session, in which case you will see all the curl output in the terminal window. If you wish to keep a log of duck.sh activity, the following will get the job done: Make a directory to hold log files: $ mkdir -p ~/Logs Edit the last line of the crontab like this: */5 * * * * duck.sh >>./Logs/duck.log 2 > & 1 Remember to prune the log from time to time.

PiVPN \u00b6 pimylifeup.com has an excellent tutorial on how to install PiVPN In point 17 and 18 they mention using noip for their dynamic DNS. Here you can use the DuckDNS address if you created one. Don't forget you need to open the port 1194 on your firewall. Most people won't be able to VPN from inside their network so download OpenVPN client for your mobile phone and try to connect over mobile data.

This is mainly due to databases potentially being in a state that could cause data loss.

If it's not clean git clone, errors may occur, or your data may not be restored correctly even if no errors are apparent. When reinstalling Raspberry or migrating to a new installation, use the same user and ID (usually pi and 1000) as when you created the backup. Changing to another user ID is explicitly NOT supported. Note : It is suggested that you test that your backups can be restored after initially setting up, and anytime you add or remove a service. Major updates to services can also break backups. Usage: ./scripts/restore.sh {FILENAME=backup.tar.gz} {noask} The restore script takes 2 arguments: Filename: The name of the backup file. The file must be present in the ./backups/ directory, or a subfolder in it. That means it should be moved from ./backups/backup to ./backups/ , or that you need to specify the backup portion of the directory (see examples) NoAsk: If a second parameter is present, is acts as setting the no ask flag to true. Pre and post script hooks \u00b6 The script checks if there are any pre and post back up hooks to execute commands. Both of these files will be included in the backup, and have also been added to the .gitignore file, so that they will not be touched when IOTstack updates. Both of these scripts will be run as root. Pre-backup script hook \u00b6 The pre-backup hook script is executed before any compression happens and before anything is written to the temporary backup manifest file ( ./.tmp/backup-list_{{NAME}}.txt ). It can be used to prepare any services (such as databases that IOTstack isn't aware of) for backing up. To use it, simple create the ~/IOTstack/pre_backup.sh file. It will be executed next time a backup runs. Post-backup script hook \u00b6 The post-backup hook script is executed after the backup tarball file has been written to disk and the stack has been started back up. Any output will be included in the backup log file. To use it, simple create the ~/IOTstack/post_backup.sh file. It will be executed after the next time a backup runs. It will be provided the backup .tar.gz as its first argument. This is useful for triggering transfer of the backup to a cloud or another server, see below for possible third party integrations as to what is possible. Post restore script hook \u00b6 The post restore hook script is executed after all files have been extracted and written to disk. It can be used to apply permissions that your custom services may require. To use it, simple create a ./post_restore.sh file in IOTstack's main directory. It will be executed after a restore happens.

There are different ways of dealing with this: Not using the menu after you've made changes. Do remember to backup your customized docker-compose.yml , in case you overwrite it by mistake or habit from the menu. Use the Docker Compose inbuilt override mechanism by creating a file named docker-compose.override.yml . This limits you to changing values and appending to lists already present in your docker-compose.yml, but it's handy as changes are immediately picked up by docker-compose commands. To see the resulting final config run docker-compose config . IOTstack menu, in the default master-branch, implements a mechanism to merge the yaml file compose-override.yml with the menu-generated stack into docker-compose.yml . This can be used to add even complete new services. See below for details. This is not an actual extension mechanism, but well worth mentioning: If you need a new services that doesn't communicate with the services in IOTstack, create it completely separately and independently into its own folder, e.g. ~/customStack/docker-compose.yml . This composition can then be independently managed from that folder: cd ~/customStack and use docker-compose commands as normal. The best override is the one you don't have to make. Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack \u00b6 You can specify modifcations to the docker-compose.yml file, including your own networks and custom containers/services. Create a file called compose-override.yml in the main directory, and place your modifications into it. These changes will be merged into the docker-compose.yml file next time you run the build script. The compose-override.yml file has been added to the .gitignore file, so it shouldn't be touched when upgrading IOTstack. It has been added to the backup script, and so will be included when you back up and restore IOTstack. Always test your backups though! New versions of IOTstack may break previous builds. How it works \u00b6 After the build process has been completed, a temporary docker compose file is created in the tmp directory. The script then checks if compose-override.yml exists: If it exists, then continue to step 3 If it does not exist, copy the temporary docker compose file to the main directory and rename it to docker-compose.yml . Using the yaml_merge.py script, merge both the compose-override.yml and the temporary docker compose file together; Using the temporary file as the default values and interating through each level of the yaml structure, check to see if the compose-override.yml has a value set. Output the final file to the main directory, calling it docker-compose.yml . A word of caution \u00b6 If you specify an override for a service, and then rebuild the docker-compose.yml file, but deselect the service from the list, then the YAML merging will still produce that override. For example, lets say NodeRed was selected to have have the following override specified in compose-override.yml : services : nodered : restart : always When rebuilding the menu, ensure to have NodeRed service always included because if it's no longer included, the only values showing in the final docker-compose.yml file for NodeRed will be the restart key and its value. Docker Compose will error with the following message: Service nodered has neither an image nor a build context specified. At least one must be provided. When attempting to bring the services up with docker-compose up -d . Either remove the override for NodeRed in compose-override.yml and rebuild the stack, or ensure that NodeRed is built with the stack to fix this. Examples \u00b6 Overriding default settings \u00b6 Lets assume you put the following into the compose-override.yml file: services : mosquitto : ports : - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 Normally the mosquitto service would be built like this inside the docker-compose.yml file: version : '3.6' services : mosquitto : container_name : mosquitto image : eclipse-mosquitto restart : unless-stopped user : \"1883\" ports : - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 volumes : - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Take special note of the ports list. If you run the build script with the compose-override.yml file in place, and open up the final docker-compose.yml file, you will notice that the port list have been replaced with the ones you specified in the compose-override.yml file. version : '3.6' services : mosquitto : container_name : mosquitto image : eclipse-mosquitto restart : unless-stopped user : \"1883\" ports : - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 volumes : - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Do note that it will replace the entire list, if you were to specify services : mosquitto : ports : - 1996:1996 Then the final output will be: version : '3.6' services : mosquitto : container_name : mosquitto image : eclipse-mosquitto restart : unless-stopped user : \"1883\" ports : - 1996:1996 volumes : - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Using env files instead of docker-compose variables \u00b6 If you need or prefer to use *.env files for docker-compose environment variables in a separate file instead of using overrides, you can do so like this: services : grafana : env_file : - ./services/grafana/grafana.env environment : This will remove the default environment variables set in the template, and tell docker-compose to use the variables specified in your file. It is not mandatory that the .env file be placed in the service's service directory, but is strongly suggested. Keep in mind the PostBuild Script functionality to automatically copy your .env files into their directories on successful build if you need to. Adding custom services \u00b6 Custom services can be added in a similar way to overriding default settings for standard services. Lets add a Minecraft and rcon server to IOTstack. Firstly, put the following into compose-override.yml : services : mosquitto : ports : - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 minecraft : image : itzg/minecraft-server ports : - \"25565:25565\" volumes : - \"./volumes/minecraft:/data\" environment : EULA : \"TRUE\" TYPE : \"PAPER\" ENABLE_RCON : \"true\" RCON_PASSWORD : \"PASSWORD\" RCON_PORT : 28016 VERSION : \"1.15.2\" REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES : \"TRUE\" ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX : \"CFG_\" CFG_DB_HOST : \"http://localhost:3306\" CFG_DB_NAME : \"IOTstack Minecraft\" CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE : \"/run/secrets/db_password\" restart : unless-stopped rcon : image : itzg/rcon ports : - \"4326:4326\" - \"4327:4327\" volumes : - \"./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db\" secrets : db_password : file : ./db_password Then create the service directory that the new instance will use to store persistant data: mkdir -p ./volumes/minecraft and mkdir -p ./volumes/rcon_data Obviously you will need to give correct folder names depending on the volumes you specify for your custom services. If your new service doesn't require persistant storage, then you can skip this step. Then simply run the ./menu.sh command, and rebuild the stack with what ever services you had before. Using the Mosquitto example above, the final docker-compose.yml file will look like: version : '3.6' services : mosquitto : ports : - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 container_name : mosquitto image : eclipse-mosquitto restart : unless-stopped user : '1883' volumes : - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl minecraft : image : itzg/minecraft-server ports : - 25565:25565 volumes : - ./volumes/minecraft:/data environment : EULA : 'TRUE' TYPE : PAPER ENABLE_RCON : 'true' RCON_PASSWORD : PASSWORD RCON_PORT : 28016 VERSION : 1.15.2 REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES : 'TRUE' ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX : CFG_ CFG_DB_HOST : http://localhost:3306 CFG_DB_NAME : IOTstack Minecraft CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE : /run/secrets/db_password restart : unless-stopped rcon : image : itzg/rcon ports : - 4326:4326 - 4327:4327 volumes : - ./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db secrets : db_password : file : ./db_password Do note that the order of the YAML keys is not guaranteed.","title":"Custom overrides"},{"location":"Basic_setup/Custom/#custom-overrides","text":"Each time you build the stack from the menu, the Docker Compose file docker-compose.yml is recreated, losing any custom changes you've made.

It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running. The Problem \u00b6 Let\u2019s say you have three different Python-based applications that you plan to host on a single server (which could either be a physical or a virtual machine). Each of these applications makes use of a different version of Python, as well as the associated libraries and dependencies, differ from one application to another. Since we cannot have different versions of Python installed on the same machine, this prevents us from hosting all three applications on the same computer. The Solution \u00b6 Let\u2019s look at how we could solve this problem without making use of Docker. In such a scenario, we could solve this problem either by having three physical machines, or a single physical machine, which is powerful enough to host and run three virtual machines on it. Both the options would allow us to install different versions of Python on each of these machines, along with their associated dependencies. The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms. So, whenever you plan to deploy an application on the host, it would create a logical entity on it to host that application. In Docker terminology, we call this logical entity a Container or Docker Container to be more precise. Whereas the kernel of the host\u2019s operating system is shared across all the containers that are running on it. This allows each container to be isolated from the other present on the same host. Thus it supports multiple containers with different application requirements and dependencies to run on the same host, as long as they have the same operating system requirements. Docker Terminology \u00b6 Docker Images and Docker Containers are the two essential things that you will come across daily while working with Docker. In simple terms, a Docker Image is a template that contains the application, and all the dependencies required to run that application on Docker. On the other hand, as stated earlier, a Docker Container is a logical entity. In more precise terms, it is a running instance of the Docker Image. What is Docker-Compose? \u00b6 Docker Compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together. Docker compose is a simple yet powerful tool that is used to run multiple containers as a single service. For example, suppose you have an application which requires Mqtt as a communication service between IOT devices and OpenHAB instance as a Smarthome application service. In this case by docker-compose, you can create one single file (docker-compose.yml) which will create both the containers as a single service without starting each separately. It wires up the networks (literally), mounts all volumes and exposes the ports. The IOTstack with the templates and menu is a generator for that docker-compose service descriptor. How Docker Compose Works? \u00b6 use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yaml) can start all the services with a single command ( docker-compose up ) can stop all the service with a single command ( docker-compose down ) How are the containers connected \u00b6 The containers are automagically connected when we run the stack with docker-compose up. The containers using same logical network (by default) where the instances can access each other with the instance logical name. Means if there is an instance called mosquitto and an openhab , when openHAB instance need to access mqtt on that case the domain name of mosquitto will be resolved as the runnuning instance of mosquitto. How the container are connected to host machine \u00b6 Volumes \u00b6 The containers are enclosed processes which state are lost with the restart of container. To be able to persist states volumes (images or directories) can be used to share data with the host. Which means if you need to persist some database, configuration or any state you have to bind volumes where the running service inside the container will write files to that binded volume. In order to understand what a Docker volume is, we first need to be clear about how the filesystem normally works in Docker. Docker images are stored as series of read-only layers. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it -- it still exists in the underlying layer. When a Docker container is deleted, relaunching the image will start a fresh container without any of the changes made in the previously running container -- those changes are lost, thats the reason that configs, databases are not persisted, Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. In IOTstack project uses the volumes directory in general to bind these container volumes. Ports \u00b6 When containers running a we would like to delegate some services to the outside world, for example OpenHAB web frontend have to be accessible for users. There are several ways to achive that. One is mounting the port to the most machine, this called port binding. On that case service will have a dedicated port which can be accessed, one drawback is one host port can be used one serice only. Another way is reverse proxy. The term reverse proxy (or Load Balancer in some terminology) is normally applied to a service that sits in front of one or more servers (in our case containers), accepting requests from clients for resources located on the server(s). From the client point of view, the reverse proxy appears to be the web server and so is totally transparent to the remote user. Which means several service can share same port the server will route the request by the URL (virtual domain or context path). For example, there is grafana and openHAB instances, where the opeanhab.domain.tld request will be routed to openHAB instance 8181 port while grafana.domain.tld to grafana instance 3000 port. On that case the proxy have to be mapped for host port 80 and/or 444 on host machine, the proxy server will access the containers via the docker virtual network.

The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms.

Working copies of the configuration files (copied from \u2778). Everything in \u277d: will be replaced if it is not present when the container starts; but will never be overwritten if altered by you. How Blynk Server gets built for IOTstack \u00b6 GitHub Updates \u00b6 Periodically, the source code is updated and a new version is released. You can check for the latest version at the releases page . IOTstack menu \u00b6 When you select Blynk Server in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run \u00b6 On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the blynk_server fragment, it finds: blynk_server : build : context : ./.templates/blynk_server/. args : - BLYNK_SERVER_VERSION=0.41.16 The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/blynk_server/Dockerfile The BLYNK_SERVER_VERSION argument is passed into the build process. This implicitly pins each build to the version number in the Compose file (eg 0.41.16). If you need to update to a The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: FROM ubuntu The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add packages to satisfy dependencies. Add the default versions of the configuration files so that the container can perform self-repair each time it is launched. Download an install the Java package that implements the Blynk Server. The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Blynk Server has been built, you may see two rows that are relevant: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_blynk_server latest 3cd6445f8a7e 3 hours ago 652MB ubuntu latest 897590a6c564 7 days ago 49.8MB ubuntu is the base image ; and iotstack_blynk_server is the local image . You may see the same pattern in Portainer , which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Whether you see one or two rows depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Logging \u00b6 You can inspect Blynk Server's log by: $ docker logs blynk_server Changing Blynk Server's configuration \u00b6 The first time you launch the blynk_server container, the following structure will be created in the persistent storage area: ~/IOTstack/volumes/blynk_server \u251c\u2500\u2500 [drwxr-xr-x pi ] config \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 [-rw-r--r-- pi ] mail.properties \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 [-rw-r--r-- pi ] server.properties \u2514\u2500\u2500 [drwxr-xr-x root ] data The two .properties files can be used to alter Blynk Server's configuration. When you make change to these files, you activate then by restarting the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart blynk_server Getting a clean slate \u00b6 Erasing Blynk Server's persistent storage area triggers self-healing and restores known defaults: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v blynk_server $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/blynk_server $ docker-compose up -d blynk_server Note: You can also remove individual configuration files and then trigger self-healing. For example, if you decide to edit server.properties and make a mess, you can restore the original default version like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ rm volumes/blynk_server/config/server.properties $ docker-compose restart blynk_server Upgrading Blynk Server \u00b6 To find out when a new version has been released, you need to visit the Blynk-Server releases page at GitHub. At the time of writing, version 0.41.16 was the most up-to-date. Suppose that version 0.41.17 has been released and that you decide to upgrade: Edit your Compose file to change the version nuumber: blynk_server : build : context : ./.templates/blynk_server/. args : - BLYNK_SERVER_VERSION=0.41.17 Note: You can use this method to pin Blynk Server to any available version. You then have two options: If you only want to reconstruct the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d blynk_server $ docker system prune -f If you want to update the Ubuntu base image at the same time: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull blynk_server $ docker-compose up -d blynk_server $ docker system prune -f $ docker system prune -f The second prune will only be needed if there is an old base image and that, in turn, depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Using Blynk Server \u00b6 See the References for documentation links. Connecting to the administrative UI \u00b6 To connect to the administrative interface, navigate to: https://<your pis IP>:9443/admin You may encounter browser security warnings which you will have to acknowledge in order to be able to connect to the page.

It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add packages to satisfy dependencies. Add the default versions of the configuration files so that the container can perform self-repair each time it is launched.

It is able to track and control all devices at your home and offer a platform for automating control. References \u00b6 Home Assistant home page Raspberry Pi installation General installation (may be useful if you are trying to run on other hardware). GitHub repository DockerHub Home Assistant: two versions \u00b6 There are two versions of Home Assistant: Home Assistant Container; and Supervised Home Assistant (also known as both \"Hass.io\" and \"Home Assistant Core\"). Each version: provides a web-based management interface on port 8123; and runs in \"host mode\" in order to discover devices on your LAN, including devices communicating via multicast traffic. Home Assistant Container runs as a single Docker container, and doesn't support all the features that Supervised Home Assistant does (such as add-ons). Supervised Home Assistant runs as a collection of Docker containers under its own orchestration. The only method supported by IOTstack is Home Assistant Container. To understand why, see about Supervised Home Assistant . If Home Assistant Container will not do what you want then, basically, you will need two Raspberry Pis: One running Raspberry Pi OS (\"Raspbian\") hosting IOTstack; and Another dedicated to running Home Assistant Operating System . Installing Home Assistant Container \u00b6 Home Assistant (Container) can be found in the Build Stack menu. Selecting it in this menu results in a service definition being added to: ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml When you choose \"Home Assistant\", the service definition added to your docker-compose.yml includes the following: image : ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable #image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant:stable #image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/raspberrypi4-homeassistant:stable The active image is generic in the sense that it should work on any platform. You may wish to edit your docker-compose.yml to deactivate the generic image in favour of an image tailored to your hardware. The normal IOTstack commands apply to Home Assistant Container such as: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Using bluetooth from the container \u00b6 In order to be able to use BT & BLE devices from HA integrations, make sure that Bluetooth is enabled: $ hciconfig hci0: Type: Primary Bus: UART BD Address: DC:89:FB:A6:32:4B ACL MTU: 1021:8 SCO MTU: 64:1 UP RUNNING RX bytes:2003 acl:0 sco:0 events:159 errors:0 TX bytes:11583 acl:0 sco:0 commands:159 errors:0 The \"UP\" in the third line of output indicates that Bluetooth is enabled. If Bluetooth is not enabled, check: $ grep \"^AutoEnable\" /etc/bluetooth/main.conf AutoEnable=true If AutoEnable is either missing or not set to true , then: Use sudo to and your favouring text editor to open: /etc/bluetooth/main.conf Find AutoEnable and make it true . If AutoEnable is missing, it needs to be added to the [Policy] section. Reboot your Raspberry Pi. Check that the Bluetooth interface is enabled. See also: Scribles: Auto Power On Bluetooth Adapter on Boot-up . HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate \u00b6 Some HA integrations (e.g google assistant) require your HA API to be accessible via https with a valid certificate. You can configure HA to do this: docs / guide or use a reverse proxy container, as described below. The linuxserver Secure Web Access Gateway container ( swag ) ( Docker hub docs ) will automatically generate a SSL-certificate, update the SSL certificate before it expires and act as a reverse proxy. First test your HA is working correctly: http://raspberrypi.local:8123/ (assuming your RPi hostname is raspberrypi) Make sure you have duckdns working. On your internet router, forward public port 443 to the RPi port 443 Add swag to ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml beneath the services: -line: swag : image : ghcr.io/linuxserver/swag cap_add : - NET_ADMIN environment : - PUID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?IOTSTACK_UID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - PGID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?IOTSTACK_GID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - TZ=Etc/UTC - URL=<yourdomain>.duckdns.org - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=duckdns - DUCKDNSTOKEN=<token> - CERTPROVIDER=zerossl - EMAIL=<e-mail> # required when using zerossl volumes : - ./volumes/swag/config:/config ports : - 443:443 restart : unless-stopped Replace the bracketed values. Do NOT use any \"-characters to enclose the values. Start the swag container, this creates the file to be edited in the next step: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Check it starts up OK: docker-compose logs -f swag . It will take a minute or two before it finally logs \"Server ready\". Enable reverse proxy for raspberrypi.local . homassistant.* is already by default. and fix homeassistant container name (\"upstream_app\"): $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sed -e 's/server_name/server_name *.local/' \\ volumes/swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/homeassistant.subdomain.conf.sample \\ > volumes/swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/homeassistant.subdomain.conf Forward to correct IP when target is a container running in \"network_mode: host\" (like Home Assistant does): Note: in order for copy-paste to work properly, the usual $-prompts are omitted cd ~/IOTstack cat << 'EOF' | sudo tee volumes/swag/config/custom-cont-init.d/add-host.docker.internal.sh #!/bin/sh DOCKER_GW=$(ip route | awk 'NR==1 {print $3}') sed -i -e \"s/upstream_app .*/upstream_app ${DOCKER_GW};/\" \\ /config/nginx/proxy-confs/homeassistant.subdomain.conf EOF sudo chmod u+x volumes/swag/config/custom-cont-init.d/add-host.docker.internal.sh (This needs to be copy-pasted/entered as-is, ignore any \"> \"-prefixes printed by bash) (optional) Add reverse proxy password protection if you don't want to rely on the HA login for security, doesn't affect API-access: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sed -i -e 's/#auth_basic/auth_basic/' \\ volumes/swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/homeassistant.subdomain.conf $ docker-compose exec swag htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd anyusername Add use_x_forwarded_for and trusted_proxies to your homeassistant http config .

That script stopped working when Home Assistant changed their approach. The script's author made it clear that script's future was bleak so the affordance was removed from IOTstack . For a time, you could manually install Supervised Home Assistant using their installation instructions for advanced users . Once you got HA working, you could install IOTstack, and the two would (mostly) happily coexist. The direction being taken by the Home Assistant folks is to supply a ready-to-run image for your Raspberry Pi . They still support the installation instructions for advanced users but the requirements are very specific. In particular: Debian Linux Debian 11 aka Bullseye (no derivatives) Raspberry Pi OS is a Debian derivative and it is becoming increasingly clear that the \"no derivatives\" part of that requirement must be taken literally and seriously. Recent examples of significant incompatibilities include: introducing a dependency on grub (GRand Unified Bootloader) . The Raspberry Pi does not use grub but the change is actually about forcing Control Groups version 1 when the Raspberry Pi uses version 2. unilaterally starting systemd-resolved . This is a DNS resolver which claims port 53. That means you can't run your own DNS service like PiHole, AdGuardHome or BIND9 as an IOTstack container. Because of the self-updating nature of Supervised Home Assistant, your Raspberry Pi might be happily running Supervised Home Assistant plus IOTstack one day, and suddenly start misbehaving the next day, simply because Supervised Home Assistant assumed it was in total control of your Raspberry Pi. If you want Supervised Home Assistant to work, reliably, it really needs to be its own dedicated appliance. If you want IOTstack to work, reliably, it really needs to be kept well away from Supervised Home Assistant.

Reducing flash wear-out \u00b6 SSD-drives have pretty good controllers spreading out writes, so this isn't a this isn't really a concern for them. But if you store data on a SD-card, flash wear may cause the card to fail prematurely. Flash memory has a limited number of erase-write cycles per physical block. These blocks may be multiple megabytes. You can use sudo lsblk -D to see how big the erase granularity is on your card. The goal is to avoid writing lots of small changes targeting the same physical blocks. Here are some tips to mitigate SD-card wear: Don't use short retention policies. This may mask heavy disk IO without increasing disk space usage. Depending on the flash card and file system used, new data may be re-written to the same blocks that were freed by the expiration, wearing them out. Take care not to add measurements too often. If possible no more often than once a minute. Add all measurements in one operation. Even a small write will physically write a whole new block and erase the previously used block. Adding measurements directly to Influxdb will cause a write on every operation. If your client code can't aggregate multiple measurements into one write, consider routing them via Telegraf. It has the flush_interval -option, which will combine the measurements into one write. All InfluxDB queries are logged by default and logs are written to the SD-card. To disable this, add into docker-compose.yml, next to the other INFLUXDB_* entries: - INFLUXDB_DATA_QUERY_LOG_ENABLED=false - INFLUXDB_HTTP_LOG_ENABLED=false This is especially important if you plan on having Grafana or Chronograf displaying up-to-date data on a dashboard, making queries all the time.

DockerHub does not have a 32-bit image for InfluxDB 2 so you can't run this container until you have upgraded. Running full 64-bit is not the same as enabling the 64-bit kernel in /boot/config.txt . User-mode needs to be 64-bit capable as well. You must start from a full 64-bit image . Node-RED is your principal mechanism for feeding data to InfluxDB 1.8. You may have other services feeding data to InfluxDB 1.8 (eg Telegraf). The steps documented here will migrate all your existing data but do not discuss how to adapt services other than Node-RED to feed new data to InfluxDB 2. Grafana is your principle mechanism for creating dashboards based on data stored in InfluxDB 1.8. You may have other visualisation tools. You may gain insights from studying how Grafana needs to be changed to run Flux queries against InfluxDB 2 buckets but this documentation does not explore alternatives. Node-RED, InfluxDB 1.8 and Grafana are all running in non-host mode on the same Docker instance, and that it is your intention to deploy InfluxDB 2 in non-host mode as well. If you are running any containers in host mode or have distributed the services across multiple Docker instances, you will have to adapt appropriately. terminology: database vs bucket \u00b6 InfluxDB 1.8 and InfluxDB 2 are both database management systems (DBMS), sometimes referred to as \"engines\", optimised for storage and retrieval of time-series data. InfluxDB 1.8 uses the term database to mean a collection of measurements . InfluxDB 2 uses the term bucket to mean the same thing. When an InfluxDB 1.8 database is migrated, it becomes an InfluxDB 2 bucket . You will see this change in terminology in various places, such as the InfluxDB-out node in Node-RED. When that node is set to: Version 1.x, the user interface has a \"Database\" field which travels with the connection . For example: [v1.x] influxdb:8086/power (set up in the connection sheet) This implies that you need one connection per database . Version 2.0, the user interface has a \"Bucket\" field which is independent of the connection. For example: [v2.0] influxdb:8086 (set up in the connection sheet) Bucket power/autogen (set up in the node) This implies that you need one connection per engine . It is a subtle but important difference. reference service definition \u00b6 The InfluxDB 2 service definition is added to your compose file by the IOTstack menu. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 influxdb2 : container_name : influxdb2 image : \"influxdb:latest\" restart : unless-stopped environment : - TZ=Etc/UTC - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=me - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=mypassword - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=myorg - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=mybucket - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=my-super-secret-auth-token - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade ports : - \"8087:8086\" volumes : - ./volumes/influxdb2/data:/var/lib/influxdb2 - ./volumes/influxdb2/config:/etc/influxdb2 - ./volumes/influxdb2/backup:/var/lib/backup # - ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data:/var/lib/influxdb:ro healthcheck : test : [ \"CMD\" , \"influx\" , \"ping\" ] interval : 30s timeout : 10s retries : 3 start_period : 30s As an alternative to using the menu, you can copy and paste the service definition into your compose file from the template at: ~/IOTstack/.templates/influxdb2/service.yml required edits \u00b6 Edit the service definition in your compose file to change the following variables: TZ= \u00abcountry\u00bb/\u00abcity\u00bb DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME= \u00abusername\u00bb This name becomes the administrative user. It is associated with your \u00abpassword\u00bb and \u00abtoken\u00bb . DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD= \u00abpassword\u00bb Your \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb form your login credentials when you administer InfluxDB 2 using its web-based graphical user interface. The strength of your password is up to you. DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG= \u00aborganisation\u00bb An organisation name is required . Examples: myorg my-house com.mydomain.myhouse DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET= \u00abbucket\u00bb A default bucket name is required . The name does not matter because you won't actually be using it so you can accept the default of \"mybucket\". You can delete the unused bucket later if you want to be tidy. DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN= \u00abtoken\u00bb Although you can let InfluxDB 2 generate your access token for you, it will keep things simple if you generate your own. Here are some possible approaches: use a universally-unique ID: $ uuidgen 4fef85b4-2f56-480f-b143-fa5cb6e8f18a use GnuPG to generate a random string: $ gpg --gen-random -a 0 25 bYS3EsnnY0AlRxJ2uk44Hzwm7GMKYu5unw == use a password-generator of your choosing. Note: Unless a container's documentation explicitly states that it is supported, you should never use quote marks to encapsulate the values you supply via environment variables. InfluxDB 2 treats quotes as being part of the value (eg a password of \"fred\" is the 6-character string that includes the quotes). If you put quote marks around anything as you were editing, please go back and remove them. Table 1: mode-specific directives \u00b6 InfluxDB 2 operates in three distinct modes which are controlled by the DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE environment variable. The table below summarises the variables and volumes mappings that need to be active in each mode. initialising InfluxDB 2 \u00b6 If you have only just included the template service definition in your compose file and performed the required edits , then you can follow the initialisation process below. However, if you want to re-initialise the container, go to re-initialising InfluxDB 2 . To initialise InfluxDB 2: Confirm that the service definition directives are set as per the \"setup\" column of Table 1 . Be in the correct directory (assumed throughout): $ cd ~/IOTstack Start the InfluxDB 2 container: $ docker-compose up -d influxdb2 InfluxDB 2 will notice the following environment variable: DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup This instructs the container to initialise the database engine structures based on a combination of defaults and the values you provide via the other environment variables. Confirm that the InfluxDB 2 container is not in a restart loop and isn't reporting errors by using commands like: $ docker ps $ docker logs influxdb2 If you don't need to migrate any data from InfluxDB 1.8 you can go straight to running InfluxDB 2 , otherwise follow the data-migration procedure instructions below. data-migration procedure \u00b6 Successful migration depends on the following assumptions being true: The InfluxDB 2 container is running and has just been initialised as per initialising InfluxDB 2 . The InfluxDB 1.8 container is running, and is based on the IOTstack service definition (or reasonable facsimile) at: ~/IOTstack/.templates/influxdb/service.yml To migrate your InfluxDB 1.8 data: Be in the correct directory (assumed throughout): $ cd ~/IOTstack InfluxDB 1.8 runs as root and its persistent store is owned by root but not all files and folders in the persistent store are group or world readable. InfluxDB 2 runs as user ID 1000 (user \"influxdb\" inside the container). Because of this, you need to give InfluxDB 2 permission to read the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store. It is not a good idea to interfere with a persistent store while a container is running so best practice is to stop InfluxDB 1.8 for long enough to make a copy of its persistent store: $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb.migrate $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v influxdb $ sudo cp -a ./volumes/influxdb ./volumes/influxdb.migrate $ docker-compose up -d influxdb $ sudo chown -R 1000 :1000 ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data In words: Ensure any previous attempts at migration are removed. Always be extremely careful with any sudo rm command. Check your work before you press return . Stop InfluxDB 1.8. Make a copy of the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store. Start InfluxDB 1.8 again. Change ownership of the copy of the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store. Edit your compose file as per the \"upgrade\" column of Table 1 . The changes you need to make are: Change the initialisation mode from setup to upgrade : before editing: 12 13 - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade after editing: 12 13 # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade Activate the volume mapping to give InfluxDB 2 read-only access to the copy of the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store that you made in step 2: before editing: 20 # - ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data:/var/lib/influxdb:ro after editing: 20 - ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data:/var/lib/influxdb:ro Save your work but do not execute any docker-compose commands. InfluxDB 2 creates a \"bolt\" (lock) file to prevent accidental data-migrations. That file needs to be removed: $ rm ./volumes/influxdb2/data/influxd.bolt The InfluxDB 2 container is still running. The following command causes the container to be recreated with the edits you made in step 3: $ docker-compose up -d influxdb2 InfluxDB 2 will notice the following environment variable: DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade This, combined with the absence of the \"bolt\" file, starts the migration process. You need to wait until the migration is complete. The simplest way to do that is to watch the size of the persistent store for InfluxDB 2 until it stops increasing. Experience suggests that the InfluxDB 2 persistent store will usually be a bit larger than InfluxDB 1.8. For example: reference size for an InfluxDB 1.8 installation: $ sudo du -sh ./volumes/influxdb 633M ./volumes/influxdb final size after migration to InfluxDB 2: $ sudo du -sh ./volumes/influxdb2 721M ./volumes/influxdb2 Data migration is complete once the folder size stops changing. Proceed to running InfluxDB 2 below. running InfluxDB 2 \u00b6 The container now needs to be instructed to run in normal mode. Be in the correct directory (assumed throughout): $ cd ~/IOTstack Edit your compose file as per the \"(omitted)\" column of Table 1 . The changes are: Deactivate all DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ environment variables. After editing, the relevant lines should look like: 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=me # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=mypassword # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=myorg # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=mybucket # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=my-super-secret-auth-token # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade Deactivate the volume mapping if it is active. After editing, the line should look like: 20 # - ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data:/var/lib/influxdb:ro Save your work. The InfluxDB 2 container is still running. The following command causes the container to be recreated with the edits you have just made: $ docker-compose up -d influxdb2 The absence of an active DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE variable places InfluxDB 2 into normal run mode. If you have just performed a data migration, you can remove the copy of the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store: $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb.migrate always be extremely careful with any sudo rm command. Always check your work before you press return . re-initialising InfluxDB 2 \u00b6 If you need to start over from a clean slate: Be in the correct directory (assumed throughout): $ cd ~/IOTstack Terminate the InfluxDB 2 container: $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v influxdb2 Remove the persistent store: $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb2 always be extremely careful with any sudo rm command. Always check your work before you press return . Edit your compose file as per the \"setup\" column of Table 1 . After editing, the relevant lines should look like this: 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=me - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=mypassword - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=myorg - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET=mybucket - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=my-super-secret-auth-token - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup # - DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=upgrade Go to initialising InfluxDB 2 . exploring InfluxDB 2 data \u00b6 Launch a browser and connect it to port 8087 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:8087 You can also use the IP address or domain name of your Raspberry Pi. In this context, 8087 is the external port number from the left hand side of the port mapping in the service definition: 14 15 ports : - \"8087:8086\" Sign in to the InfluxDB 2 instance using your \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb . Click on \"Explore\" in the left-hand tool strip. That is marked [A] in the screen shot. In the area marked [B] you should be able to see a list of the buckets that were migrated from InfluxDB 1.8 databases . In the screen shot, I clicked on other fields to create a query: In area [B], I selected the \"power/autogen\" bucket ; In area [C], I selected the \"hiking2\" (electricity meter) measurement ; In area [D], I selected the \"voltage\" field ; The bucket in this test is a migrated copy of an InfluxDB 1.8 database. It was not ingesting live data so I also needed to change the duration popup menu [E] to a time-span that included the most-recent insertions; Then I clicked the \"Submit\" button [F]; and The result was the graph in [G]. You can explore your own tables using similar techniques. Flux queries via point-and-click \u00b6 Grafana does not (yet) seem to have the ability to let you build Flux queries via point-and-click like you can with InfluxQL queries. Until Grafana gains that ability, it's probably a good idea to learn how to build Flux queries in InfluxDB, so you can copy-and-paste the Flux statements into Grafana. Once you have constructed a query in the \"Query Builder\", click the \"Script Editor\" button [H] to switch to the editor view. For this example, the query text is: from(bucket: \"power/autogen\") |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop) |> filter(fn: (r) => r[\"_measurement\"] == \"hiking2\") |> filter(fn: (r) => r[\"_field\"] == \"voltage\") |> aggregateWindow(every: v.windowPeriod, fn: mean, createEmpty: false) |> yield(name: \"mean\") Two important things to note here are: The bucket name: power/autogen ; and The measurement name: hiking2 . example: adapting Node-RED \u00b6 Assume you have an existing flow (eg a fairly standard 3-node flow ) which is logging to an InfluxDB 1.8 database. Your goal is to modify the flow to log the same data to the recently-migrated InfluxDB 2 bucket. Start Node-RED if it is not running: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d nodered Use a web browser to connect to your Node-RED instance. Drag a new InfluxDB-out node onto the canvas: This is exactly the same InfluxDB-out node that you have been using to write to your InfluxDB 1.8 databases. There isn't a different node or package for InfluxDB 2. Always drag a new InfluxDB-out node from the palette onto the canvas. Do not make the mistake of re-using an existing InfluxDB-out node (eg via copy and paste) because that is a very good way of breaking your flows. Double-click the InfluxDB-out node to open it: At [A], give the node a sensible name. Click the pencil icon [B] adjacent to the Server field: Leave the Name field [C] blank.

InfluxDB 2 runs as user ID 1000 (user \"influxdb\" inside the container). Because of this, you need to give InfluxDB 2 permission to read the InfluxDB 1.8 persistent store. It is not a good idea to interfere with a persistent store while a container is running so best practice is to stop InfluxDB 1.8 for long enough to make a copy of its persistent store: $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb.migrate $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v influxdb $ sudo cp -a ./volumes/influxdb ./volumes/influxdb.migrate $ docker-compose up -d influxdb $ sudo chown -R 1000 :1000 ./volumes/influxdb.migrate/data In words: Ensure any previous attempts at migration are removed.

You need to wait until the migration is complete. The simplest way to do that is to watch the size of the persistent store for InfluxDB 2 until it stops increasing. Experience suggests that the InfluxDB 2 persistent store will usually be a bit larger than InfluxDB 1.8. For example: reference size for an InfluxDB 1.8 installation: $ sudo du -sh ./volumes/influxdb 633M ./volumes/influxdb final size after migration to InfluxDB 2: $ sudo du -sh ./volumes/influxdb2 721M ./volumes/influxdb2 Data migration is complete once the folder size stops changing.

If you need change that port, you also need to inform the health-check agent via an environment variable. For example, suppose you changed the internal port to 12345: environment : - MYSQL_TCP_PORT=12345 Notes: The MYSQL_TCP_PORT variable is defined by MariaDB , not IOTstack, so changing this variable affects more than just the health-check agent. If you are running \"old menu\", this change should be made in the file: ~/IOTstack/services/mariadb/mariadb.env The mysqladmin ping command relies on the root password supplied via the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable in the Compose file. The command will not succeed if the root password is not correct, and the agent will return \"unhealthy\".

The Dockerfile used to customise Mosquitto for IOTstack. A replacement for the Eclipse-Mosquitto script of the same name, extended to handle container self-repair. A standard set of defaults for IOTstack (used to initialise defaults on first run, and for container self-repair). The working service definition (only relevant to old-menu, copied from \u2776). The Compose file (includes \u2776). The persistent storage area : Directories and files in \u277c are owned by userID 1883. This is enforced each time Mosquitto starts. You will normally need sudo to make changes in this area. Each time Mosquitto starts, it automatically replaces anything originating in \u2779 that has gone missing from \u277c. This \"self-repair\" function is intended to provide reasonable assurance that Mosquitto will at least start instead of going into a restart loop. How Mosquitto gets built for IOTstack \u00b6 Mosquitto source code ( GitHub ) \u00b6 The source code for Mosquitto lives at GitHub eclipse/mosquitto . Mosquitto images ( DockerHub ) \u00b6 Periodically, the source code is recompiled and the resulting image is pushed to eclipse-mosquitto on DockerHub . IOTstack menu \u00b6 When you select Mosquitto in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run \u00b6 On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose Mosquitto as one of your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d See also the Migration considerations (below). docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the mosquitto fragment, it finds: mosquitto : container_name : mosquitto build : context : ./.templates/mosquitto/. args : - MOSQUITTO_BASE=eclipse-mosquitto:latest \u2026 Note: Earlier versions of the Mosquitto service definition looked like this: mosquitto : container_name : mosquitto build : ./.templates/mosquitto/. \u2026 The single-line build produces exactly the same result as the four-line build , save that the single-line form does not support pinning Mosquitto to a specific version . The ./.templates/mosquitto/. path associated with the build tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: ARG MOSQUITTO_BASE = eclipse-mosquitto:latest FROM $MOSQUITTO_BASE The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add the rsync and tzdata packages. rsync helps the container perform self-repair; while tzdata enables Mosquitto to respect the \"TZ\" environment variable. Add a standard set of configuration defaults appropriate for IOTstack. Replace docker-entrypoint.sh with a version which: Calls rsync to perform self-repair if configuration files go missing; and Enforces 1883:1883 ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto . The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Mosquitto has been built, you may see two rows for Mosquitto: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_mosquitto latest cf0bfe1a34d6 4 weeks ago 11.6MB eclipse-mosquitto latest 46ad1893f049 4 weeks ago 8.31MB eclipse-mosquitto is the base image ; and iotstack_mosquitto is the local image . You may see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Whether you see one or two rows depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Migration considerations \u00b6 Under the original IOTstack implementation of Mosquitto (just \"as it comes\" from DockerHub ), the service definition expected the configuration files to be at: ~/IOTstack/services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ~/IOTstack/services/mosquitto/filter.acl Under this implementation of Mosquitto, the configuration files have moved to: ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/filter.acl The change of location is one of the things that allows self-repair to work properly. The default versions of each configuration file are the same . Only the locations have changed. If you did not alter either file when you were running the original IOTstack implementation of Mosquitto, there will be no change in Mosquitto's behaviour when it is built from a Dockerfile . However, if you did alter either or both configuration files, then you should compare the old and new versions and decide whether you wish to retain your old settings. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ diff ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf You can also use the -y option on the diff command to see a side-by-side comparison of the two files. Using mosquitto.conf as the example, assume you wish to use your existing file instead of the default: To move your existing file into the new location: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo mv ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf The move overwrites the default. At this point, the moved file will probably be owned by user \"pi\" but that does not matter. Mosquitto will always enforce correct ownership (1883:1883) on any restart but it will not overwrite permissions. If in doubt, use mode 644 as your default for permissions: $ sudo chmod 644 ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf Restart Mosquitto: $ docker-compose restart mosquitto Check your work: $ ls -l ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 1883 1883 ssss mmm dd hh:mm ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf If necessary, repeat these steps with filter.acl . Logging \u00b6 Mosquitto logging is controlled by mosquitto.conf . This is the default configuration: #log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log log_dest stdout log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S # Reduce size and SD-card flash wear, safe to remove if using a SSD connection_messages false When log_dest is set to stdout , you inspect Mosquitto's logs like this: $ docker logs mosquitto Logs written to stdout are stored and persisted to disk as managed by Docker. They are kept over reboots, but are lost when your Mosquitto container is removed or updated. The alternative, which may be more appropriate if you are running on an SSD or HD, is to change mosquitto.conf to be like this: log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log #log_dest stdout log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and then restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart mosquitto The path /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log is an internal path. When this style of logging is active, you inspect Mosquitto's logs using the external path like this: $ sudo tail ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log You need to use sudo because the log is owned by userID 1883 and Mosquitto creates it without \"world\" read permission. Logs written to mosquitto.log persist until you take action to prune the file. Security \u00b6 Configuring security \u00b6 Mosquitto security is controlled by mosquitto.conf . These are the relevant directives: #password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile allow_anonymous true Mosquitto security can be in four different states, which are summarised in the following table: password_file allow_anonymous security enforcement remark disabled true open access default disabled false all access denied not really useful enabled true credentials optional enabled false credentials required Password file management \u00b6 The password file for Mosquitto is part of a mapped volume: The internal path is /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile The external path is ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile A common problem with the previous version of Mosquitto for IOTstack occurred when the password_file directive was enabled but the pwfile was not present. Mosquitto went into a restart loop. The Mosquitto container performs self-repair each time the container is brought up or restarts. If pwfile is missing, an empty file is created as a placeholder. This prevents the restart loop. What happens next depends on allow_anonymous : If true then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be permitted; Any MQTT request with credentials will be rejected (because pwfile is empty so there is nothing to match on). If false then all MQTT requests will be rejected. create username and password \u00b6 To create a username and password, use the following as a template. $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb \u00abpassword\u00bb Replace \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb with appropriate values, then execute the command. For example, to create the username \"hello\" with password \"world\": $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile hello world Note: See also customising health-check . If you are creating usernames and passwords, you may also want to create credentials for the health-check agent. check password file \u00b6 There are two ways to verify that the password file exists and has the expected content: View the file using its external path: $ sudo cat ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile sudo is needed because the file is neither owned nor readable by pi . View the file using its internal path: $ docker exec mosquitto cat /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile Each credential starts with the username and occupies one line in the file: hello:$7$101$ZFOHHVJLp2bcgX+h$MdHsc4rfOAhmGG+65NpIEJkxY0beNeFUyfjNAGx1ILDmI498o4cVOaD9vDmXqlGUH9g6AgHki8RPDEgjWZMkDA== remove entry from password file \u00b6 To remove an entry from the password file: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -D /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb reset the password file \u00b6 There are several ways to reset the password file. Your options are: Remove the password file and restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo rm ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile $ docker-compose restart mosquitto The result is an empty password file. Clear all existing passwords while adding a new password: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -c -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb \u00abpassword\u00bb The result is a password file with a single entry. Clear all existing passwords in favour of a single dummy password which is then removed: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -c -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile dummy dummy $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -D /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile dummy The result is an empty password file. Activate Mosquitto security \u00b6 Use sudo and your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf Remove the comment indicator from the following line: #password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile so that it becomes: password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile Set allow_anonymous as required: allow_anonymous true If true then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be permitted; The validity of credentials supplied with any MQTT request will be enforced. If false then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be rejected; The validity of credentials supplied with any MQTT request will be enforced. Save the modified configuration file and restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart mosquitto Testing Mosquitto security \u00b6 assumptions \u00b6 You have created at least one username (\"hello\") and password (\"world\"). password_file is enabled. allow_anonymous is false . install testing tools \u00b6 If you do not have the Mosquitto clients installed on your Raspberry Pi (ie $ which mosquitto_pub does not return a path), install them using: $ sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients test: anonymous access is prohibited \u00b6 Test without providing credentials: $ mosquitto_pub -h 127 .0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" Connection Refused: not authorised. Error: The connection was refused. Note: The error is the expected result and shows that Mosquitto will not allow anonymous access. test: access with credentials is permitted \u00b6 Test with credentials $ mosquitto_pub -h 127 .0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" -u hello -P world $ Note: The absence of any error message means the message was sent. Silence = success! test: round-trip with credentials is permitted \u00b6 Prove round-trip connectivity will succeed when credentials are provided. First, set up a subscriber as a background process. This mimics the role of a process like Node-Red: $ mosquitto_sub -v -h 127 .0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -F \"%I %t %p\" -u hello -P world & [1] 25996 Repeat the earlier test: $ mosquitto_pub -h 127 .0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" -u hello -P world 2021-02-16T14:40:51+1100 /password/test up up and away Note: the second line above is coming from the mosquitto_sub running in the background. When you have finished testing you can kill the background process (press return twice after you enter the kill command): $ kill %1 $ [1]+ Terminated mosquitto_sub -v -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -F \"%I %t %p\" -u hello -P world Container health check \u00b6 theory of operation \u00b6 A script , or \"agent\", to assess the health of the Mosquitto container has been added to the local image via the Dockerfile . In other words, the script is specific to IOTstack. The agent is invoked 30 seconds after the container starts, and every 30 seconds thereafter. The agent: Publishes a retained MQTT message to the broker running in the same container. The message payload is the current date and time, and the default topic string is: iotstack/mosquitto/healthcheck Subscribes to the same broker for the same topic for a single message event. Compares the payload sent with the payload received. If the payloads (ie time-stamps) match, the agent concludes that the Mosquitto broker (the process running inside the same container) is functioning properly for round-trip messaging. monitoring health-check \u00b6 Portainer's Containers display contains a Status column which shows health-check results for all containers that support the feature. You can also use the docker ps command to monitor health-check results. The following command narrows the focus to mosquitto: $ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Status}}\" --filter name = mosquitto Possible reply patterns are: The container is starting and has not yet run the health-check agent: NAMES STATUS mosquitto Up 3 seconds (health: starting) The container has been running for at least 30 seconds and the health-check agent has returned a positive result within the last 30 seconds: NAMES STATUS mosquitto Up 34 seconds (healthy) The container has been running for more than 90 seconds but has failed the last three successive health-check tests: NAMES STATUS mosquitto Up About a minute (unhealthy) You can also subscribe to the same topic that the health-check agent is using to view the retained messages as they are published: $ mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -p 1883 -t \"iotstack/mosquitto/healthcheck\" -F \"%I %t %p\" Notes: This assumes you are running the command outside container-space on the same host as your Mosquitto container. If you run this command from another host, replace localhost with the IP address or domain name of the host where your Mosquitto container is running. The -p 1883 is the external port. You will need to adjust this if you are using a different external port for your MQTT service. If you enable authentication for your Mosquitto broker, you will need to add -u \u00abuser\u00bb and -P \u00abpassword\u00bb parameters to this command. You should expect to see a new message appear approximately every 30 seconds. That indicates the health-check agent is functioning normally. Use control + c to terminate the command. customising health-check \u00b6 You can customise the operation of the health-check agent by editing the mosquitto service definition in your Compose file: By default, the mosquitto broker listens to internal port 1883. If you need change that port, you also need to inform the health-check agent via an environment variable. For example, suppose you changed the internal port to 12345: environment : - HEALTHCHECK_PORT=12345 If the default topic string used by the health-check agent causes a name-space collision, you can override it. For example, you could use a Universally-Unique Identifier (UUID): environment : - HEALTHCHECK_TOPIC=4DAA361F-288C-45D5-9540-F1275BDCAF02 Note: You will also need to use the same topic string in the mosquitto_sub command shown at monitoring health-check . If you have enabled authentication for your Mosquitto broker service, you will need to provide appropriate credentials for your health-check agent: environment : - HEALTHCHECK_USER=healthyUser - HEALTHCHECK_PASSWORD=healthyUserPassword If the health-check agent misbehaves in your environment, or if you simply don't want it to be active, you can disable all health-checking for the container by adding the following lines to its service definition: healthcheck : disable : true Notes: The directives to disable health-checking are independent of the environment variables. If you want to disable health-checking temporarily, there is no need to remove any HEALTHCHECK_ environment variables that may already be in place. Conversely, the mere presence of a healthcheck: clause in the mosquitto service definition overrides the supplied agent. In other words, the following can't be used to re-enable the supplied agent: healthcheck : disable : false You must remove the entire healthcheck: clause. Upgrading Mosquitto \u00b6 You can update most containers like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Mosquitto is available is to check the eclipse-mosquitto tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Mosquitto like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull mosquitto $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; mosquitto is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Mosquitto container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your MQTT broker service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Whether an old base image exists depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Mosquitto version pinning \u00b6 If an update to Mosquitto introduces a breaking change, you can revert to an earlier know-good version by pinning to that version. Here's how: Use your favourite text editor to open: ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml Find the Mosquitto service definition. If your service definition contains this line: build : ./.templates/mosquitto/. then replace that line with the following four lines: build : context : ./.templates/mosquitto/. args : - MOSQUITTO_BASE=eclipse-mosquitto:latest Notes: The four-line form of the build directive is now the default for Mosquitto so those lines may already be present in your compose file. Remember to use spaces, not tabs, when editing compose files. Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to. For example, to pin to version 2.0.13: - MOSQUITTO_BASE=eclipse-mosquitto:2.0.13 Save the file and tell docker-compose to rebuild the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull mosquitto $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto $ docker system prune The new local image is built, then the new container is instantiated based on that image. The prune deletes the old local image . Images built in this way will always be tagged with \"latest\", as in: $ docker images iotstack_mosquitto REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_mosquitto latest 8c0543149b9b About a minute ago 16.2MB You may find it useful to assign an explicit tag to help you remember the version number used for the build. For example: $ docker tag iotstack_mosquitto:latest iotstack_mosquitto:2.0.13 $ docker images iotstack_mosquitto REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_mosquitto 2.0.13 8c0543149b9b About a minute ago 16.2MB iotstack_mosquitto latest 8c0543149b9b About a minute ago 16.2MB You can also query the image metadata to discover version information: $ docker image inspect iotstack_mosquitto:latest | jq .

On that basis, the mapping for port 9001 was removed from service.yml . If you have a use-case that needs port 9001, you can re-enable support by: Inserting the port mapping under the mosquitto definition in docker-compose.yml : - \"9001:9001\" Inserting the additional listener in mosquitto.conf : listener 1883 listener 9001 You need both lines. If you omit 1883 then Mosquitto will stop listening to port 1883 and will only listen to port 9001.

The ./.templates/mosquitto/. path associated with the build tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: ARG MOSQUITTO_BASE = eclipse-mosquitto:latest FROM $MOSQUITTO_BASE The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add the rsync and tzdata packages. rsync helps the container perform self-repair; while tzdata enables Mosquitto to respect the \"TZ\" environment variable. Add a standard set of configuration defaults appropriate for IOTstack. Replace docker-entrypoint.sh with a version which: Calls rsync to perform self-repair if configuration files go missing; and Enforces 1883:1883 ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto .

You may see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused.

The default versions of each configuration file are the same . Only the locations have changed. If you did not alter either file when you were running the original IOTstack implementation of Mosquitto, there will be no change in Mosquitto's behaviour when it is built from a Dockerfile . However, if you did alter either or both configuration files, then you should compare the old and new versions and decide whether you wish to retain your old settings. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ diff ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf You can also use the -y option on the diff command to see a side-by-side comparison of the two files.

Initialising Nextcloud \u00b6 Be in the correct directory: $ cd ~/IOTstack If the stack is running, take it down: $ docker-compose down Erase the persistent storage area for Nextcloud (double-check the command before you hit return): $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/nextcloud This is done to force re-initialisation. In particular, it gives you assurance that the passwords in your docker-compose.yml are the ones that are actually in effect. Bring up the stack: $ docker-compose up -d Check for errors: Repeat the following command two or three times at 10-second intervals: $ docker ps You are looking for evidence that the nextcloud and nextcloud_db containers are up, stable, and not restarting. If you see any evidence of restarts, try to figure out why using: $ docker logs nextcloud If you want to be sure Nextcloud gets set up correctly, it is best to perform the remaining steps from a different computer. That means you need to decide how that other computer will refer to your Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud. Your choices are: the IP address of your Raspberry Pi \u2013 eg 192.168.203.200 your Raspberry Pi's fully-qualified domain name \u2013 eg myrpi.mydomain.com your Raspberry Pi's host name \u2013 eg myrpi Key points: You can't use a multicast domain name (eg myrpi.local ). An mDNS name will not work until Nextcloud has been initialised! Once you have picked a connection method, STICK TO IT . You are only stuck with this restriction until Nextcloud has been initialised. You can (and should) fix it later by completing the steps in \"Access through untrusted domain\" . On a computer that is not the Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud, launch a browser and point to the Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud using your chosen connection method. Examples: If you are using an IP address: http://192.168.203.200:9321 If you are using a domain name: http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321 If you are using a host name in /etc/hosts : http://myrpi:9321 The expected result is: Create an administrator account and then click \"Finish Setup\". There is a long delay. In most cases, the \"Recommended apps\" screen appears and you can ignore the instructions in this step. However, if your browser returns a \"Not Found\" error like the following: then you should: Examine the contents of your browser's URL bar. If you see this pattern: http://localhost/index.php/core/apps/recommended Edit the URL to replace localhost with what it should be, which will be one of the following patterns, depending on which method you chose to access Nextcloud: http://192.168.203.200:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended http://myrpi:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended Note: This seems to be the only time Nextcloud misbehaves and forces localhost into a URL. The \"Recommended apps\" screen appears. A spinner moves down the list of apps as they are loaded: Wait for the loading to complete. Eventually, the dashboard will appear. Then the dashboard will be obscured by the \"Nextcloud Hub\" floating window: Hover your mouse to the right of the floating window and keep clicking on the right-arrow button until you reach the last screen, then click \"Start using Nextcloud\". Congratulations. Your IOTstack implementation of Nextcloud is ready to roll: \"Access through untrusted domain\" \u00b6 During Nextcloud initialisation you had to choose between an IP address, a domain name or a host name. Now that Nextcloud is running, you have the opportunity to expand your connection options. If you are reading this because you are staring at an \"access through untrusted domain\" message then you have come to the right place. Let's assume the following: You used raspi-config to give your Raspberry Pi the name \"myrpi\". Your Raspberry Pi has the fixed IP address \"192.168.203.200\" (via either a static binding in your DHCP server or a static IP address on your Raspberry Pi). Out of the box, a Raspberry Pi participates in multicast DNS so it will also have the mDNS name: \"myrpi.local\" Let's also assume you have a local Domain Name System server where your Raspberry Pi: has the canonical name (A record) \"myrpi.mydomain.com\"; plus an alias (CNAME record) of \"nextcloud.mydomain.com\". Rolling all that together, you would expect your Nextcloud service to be reachable at any of the following URLs: http://192.168.203.200:9321 http://myrpi.local:9321 http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321 http://nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321 To tell Nextcloud that all of those URLs are valid, you need to use sudo and your favourite text editor to edit this file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/config.php Hint: It is a good idea to make a backup of any file before you edit it. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/ $ sudo cp config.php config.php.bak Search for \"trusted_domains\". To tell Nextcloud to trust all of the URLs above, edit the array structure like this: 'trusted_domains' => array ( 0 => '192.168.203.200:9321', 1 => 'myrpi.local:9321', 2 => 'myrpi.mydomain.com:9321', 3 => 'nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321', ), Note: all the trailing commas are intentional! Once you have finished editing the file, save your work then restart Nextcloud: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nextcloud Use docker ps to check that the container has restarted properly and hasn't gone into a restart loop. See also: Nextcloud documentation - trusted domains . Using a DNS alias for your Nextcloud service \u00b6 The examples above include using a DNS alias (a CNAME record) for your Nextcloud service. If you decide to do that, you may see this warning in the log: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name You can silence the warning by editing the Nextcloud service definition in docker-compose.yml to add your fully-qualified DNS alias using a hostname directive. For example: hostname : nextcloud.mydomain.com Security considerations \u00b6 Nextcloud traffic is not encrypted. Do not expose it to the web by opening a port on your home router. Instead, use a VPN like Wireguard to provide secure access to your home network, and let your remote clients access Nextcloud over the VPN tunnel. Container health check \u00b6 A script , or \"agent\", to assess the health of the MariaDB container has been added to the local image via the Dockerfile . In other words, the script is specific to IOTstack. Because it is an instance of MariaDB, Nextcloud_DB inherits the health-check agent. See the IOTstack MariaDB documentation for more information. Keeping Nextcloud up-to-date \u00b6 To update the nextcloud container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull nextcloud $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud $ docker system prune To update the nextcloud_db container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull nextcloud_db $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud_db $ docker system prune You may need to run the prune command twice if you are using a 1.x version of docker-compose . Backups \u00b6 Nextcloud is currently excluded from the IOTstack-supplied backup scripts due to its potential size. Paraphraser/IOTstackBackup includes backup and restore for NextCloud. If you want to take a backup, something like the following will get the job done: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ BACKUP_TAR_GZ = $PWD /backups/ $( date + \"%Y-%m-%d_%H%M\" ) . $HOSTNAME .nextcloud-backup.tar.gz $ touch \" $BACKUP_TAR_GZ \" $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v nextcloud nextcloud_db $ sudo tar -czf \" $BACKUP_TAR_GZ \" -C \"./volumes/nextcloud\" . $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud Notes: A baseline backup takes over 400MB and about 2 minutes. Once you start adding your own data, it will take even more time and storage. The up of the NextCloud container implies the up of the Nextcloud_DB container. To restore, you first need to identify the name of the backup file by looking in the backups directory. Then: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ RESTORE_TAR_GZ = $PWD /backups/2021-06-12_1321.sec-dev.nextcloud-backup.tar.gz $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v nextcloud nextcloud_db $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/nextcloud/* $ sudo tar -x --same-owner -z -f \" $RESTORE_TAR_GZ \" -C \"./volumes/nextcloud\" $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud If you are running from an SD card, it would be a good idea to mount an external drive to store the data. Something like: The external drive will have to be an ext4 formatted drive because smb, fat32 and NTFS can't handle Linux file permissions. If the permissions aren't set to \"www-data\" then the container won't be able to write to the disk.

Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. You choose add-on nodes from a supplementary menu. We recommend accepting the default nodes, and adding others that you think you are likely to need. Node-RED will not build if you do not select at least one add-on node. Key points: Under new menu, you must press the right arrow to access the supplementary menu. Under old menu, the list of add-on nodes is displayed automatically. Do not be concerned if you can't find an add-on node you need in the list. You can also add nodes via Manage Palette once Node-RED is running. See node management . Choosing add-on nodes in the menu causes the Dockerfile to be created. IOTstack first run \u00b6 On a first install of IOTstack, you are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the nodered service definition, it finds: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 nodered : container_name : nodered build : context : ./services/nodered/. args : - DOCKERHUB_TAG=latest - EXTRA_PACKAGES= Note: Prior to July 2022, IOTstack used the following one-line syntax for the build directive: 3 build : ./services/nodered/. The older syntax meant all local customisations (version-pinning and adding extra packages) needed manual edits to the Dockerfile . Those edits would be overwritten each time the menu was re-run to alter the selected add-on nodes. The newer multi-line syntax avoids that problem. See also updating to July 2022 syntax . In either case, the path ./services/nodered/. tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile which contains instructions to download a base image from DockerHub and then apply local customisations such as the add-on nodes you chose in the IOTstack menu. The result is a local image which is instantiated to become your running container. Notes: During the build you may see warnings and deprecation notices. You may also see messages about \"vulnerabilities\" along with recommendations to run npm audit fix . You should ignore all such messages. There is no need to take any action. If SQLite is in your list of nodes, be aware that it needs to be compiled from its source code. It takes a long time, outputs an astonishing number of warnings and, from time to time, will look as if it has gotten stuck. Be patient. Acknowledgement: Successful installation of the SQLite node is thanks to @fragolinux. When you run the docker images command after Node-RED has been built, you may see two rows for Node-RED: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_nodered latest b0b21a97b8bb 4 days ago 462MB nodered/node-red latest deb99584fa75 5 days ago 385MB nodered/node-red is the base image ; and iotstack_nodered is the local image . The local image is the one that is instantiated to become the running container. You may see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\": You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Whether you see one or two rows depends on the version of Docker you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Securing Node-RED \u00b6 Setting an encryption key for your credentials \u00b6 After you install Node-RED, you should set an encryption key. Completing this step will silence the warning you will see when you run: $ docker logs nodered \u2026 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Your flow credentials file is encrypted using a system-generated key. If the system-generated key is lost for any reason, your credentials file will not be recoverable, you will have to delete it and re-enter your credentials. You should set your own key using the 'credentialSecret' option in your settings file. Node-RED will then re-encrypt your credentials file using your chosen key the next time you deploy a change. --------------------------------------------------------------------- \u2026 Setting an encryption key also means that any credentials you create will be portable , in the sense that you can backup Node-RED on one machine and restore it on another. The encryption key can be any string. For example, if you have UUID support installed ( sudo apt install -y uuid-runtime ), you could generate a UUID as your key: $ uuidgen 2deb50d4-38f5-4ab3-a97e-d59741802e2d Once you have defined your encryption key, use sudo and your favourite text editor to open this file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/settings.js Search for credentialSecret : //credentialSecret: \"a-secret-key\", Un-comment the line and replace a-secret-key with your chosen key. Do not remove the comma at the end of the line. The result should look something like this: credentialSecret: \"2deb50d4-38f5-4ab3-a97e-d59741802e2d\", Save the file and then restart Node-RED: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Setting a username and password for Node-RED \u00b6 To secure Node-RED you need a password hash. Run the following command, replacing PASSWORD with your own password: $ docker exec nodered node -e \"console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 8));\" PASSWORD You will get an answer that looks something like this: $2a$08$gTdx7SkckJVCw1U98o4r0O7b8P.gd5/LAPlZI6geg5LRg4AUKuDhS Copy that text to your clipboard, then follow the instructions at Node-RED User Guide - Securing Node-RED - Username & Password-based authentication . Referring to other containers \u00b6 Node-RED can run in two modes. By default, it runs in \"non-host mode\" but you can also move the container to \"host mode\" by editing the Node-RED service definition in your Compose file to: Add the following directive: network_mode: host Remove the ports directive and the mapping of port 1880. When Node-RED is not in host mode \u00b6 Most examples on the web assume Node-RED and other services in the MING (Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Node-RED, Grafana) stack have been installed natively, rather than in Docker containers. Those examples typically include the loopback address + port syntax, like this: 127.0.0.1:1883 The loopback address will not work when Node-RED is in non-host mode. This is because each container behaves like a self-contained computer. The loopback address means \"this container\". It does not mean \"this Raspberry Pi\". You refer to other containers by their container name. For example, a flow subscribing to an MQTT feed provided by the mosquitto container uses: mosquitto:1883 Similarly, if a flow writes to an InfluxDB database maintained by the influxdb container, the flow uses: influxdb:8086 Behind the scenes, Docker maintains a table, similar to an /etc/hosts file, mapping container names to the IP addresses on the internal bridged network that are assigned, dynamically, by Docker, when it spins up each container. When Node-RED is in host mode \u00b6 This is where you use loopback+port syntax, such as the following to communicate with Mosquitto: 127.0.0.1:1883 What actually occurs is that Docker is listening to external port 1883 on behalf of Mosquitto. It receives the packet and routes it (layer three) to the internal bridged network, performing network address translation (NAT) along the way to map the external port to the internal port. Then the packet is delivered to Mosquitto. The reverse happens when Mosquitto replies. It works but is less efficient than when all containers are in non-host mode. GPIO Access \u00b6 To communicate with your Raspberry Pi's GPIO you need to do the following: Install dependencies: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio Install the node-red-node-pi-gpiod node. See node management . It allows you to connect to multiple Pis from the same Node-RED service. Make sure that the pigpdiod daemon is running. The recommended method is listed here . In essence, you need to: Use sudo to edit /etc/rc.local ; Before the exit 0 statement, insert the line: /usr/bin/pigpiod Reboot. You can also pass parameters to pigpiod to secure the service. See the writeup for further instructions. Drag a gpio node onto the canvas and configure it using the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg 192.168.1.123). Don't try to use 127.0.0.1 because that is the loopback address of the Node-RED container. Sharing files between Node-RED and the Raspberry Pi \u00b6 Containers run in a sandboxed environment. A process running inside a container can't see the Raspberry Pi's file system. Neither can a process running outside a container access files inside the container. This presents a problem if you want write to a file outside a container, then read from it inside the container, or vice-versa. IOTstack containers have been set up with shared volume mappings. Each volume mapping associates a specific directory in the Raspberry Pi file system with a specific directory inside the container. If you write to files in a shared directory (or one of its sub-directories), both the host and the container can see the same sub-directories and files. Key point: Files and directories in the shared volume are persistent between restarts. If you save your data anywhere else inside the container, it will be lost when the container is rebuilt. The Node-RED service definition in the Compose file includes the following: volumes : - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data That decomposes into: external path = ./volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data The leading \".\" on the external path implies \"the folder containing the Compose file so it actually means: external path = ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data If you write to the internal path from inside the Node-RED container, the Raspberry Pi will see the results at the external path, and vice versa. Example: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # echo \"The time now is $( date ) \" >/data/example.txt # cat /data/example.txt The time now is Thu Apr 1 11:25:56 AEDT 2021 # exit $ cat ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/example.txt The time now is Thu Apr 1 11:25:56 AEDT 2021 $ sudo rm ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/example.txt In words: Open a shell into the Node-RED container. Two things happen: You are now inside the container. Any commands you execute while in this shell are run inside the container; and The prompt changes to a \"#\" indicating that you are running as the \"root\" user, meaning you don't need sudo for anything. Use the echo command to create a small file which embeds the current timestamp. The path is in the /data directory which is mapped to the Raspberry Pi's file system. Show that the file has been created inside the container. Exit the shell: You can either type the exit command and press return , or press Control + D . Exiting the shell drops you out of the container so the \"$\" prompt returns, indicating that you are outside the Node-Red container, running as a non-root user (\"pi\"). Show that the same file can be seen from outside the container. Tidy-up by removing the file. You need sudo to do that because the persistent storage area at the external path is owned by root, and you are running as user \"pi\". You can do the same thing from within a Node-RED flow. The flow comprises: An Inject node, wired to a Template node. When an Inject node's input tab is clicked, it sets the message payload to the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC and triggers the flow. A Template node, wired to both a Debug node and a File node. The template field is set to: The time at the moment is {{payload}} seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC ! When this node runs, it replaces {{payload}} with the seconds value supplied by the Inject node. A Debug node. When this node runs, it displays the payload in the debug window on the right hand side of the Node-RED GUI. A File node. The \"Filename\" field of the node is set to write to the path: /data/flow-example.txt When this node runs, it writes the payload to the specified file. Remember that /data is an internal path within the Node-RED container. Deploying the flow and clicking on the Inject node results in the debug message shown on the right hand side of the screen shot. The embedded terminal window shows that the same information is accessible from outside the container. You can reverse this process. Any file you place within the path ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data can be read by a \"File in\" node. Executing commands outside the Node-RED container \u00b6 A reasonably common requirement in a Node-RED flow is the ability to execute a command on the host system. The standard tool for this is an \"exec\" node. An \"exec\" node works as expected when Node-RED is running as a native service but not when Node-RED is running in a container. That's because the command spawned by the \"exec\" node runs inside the container. To help you understand the difference, consider this command: $ grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release When you run that command on a Raspberry Pi outside container-space, the answer will be something like: PRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\" If you run the same command inside a Node-RED container, the output will reflect the operating system upon which the container is based, such as: PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.11\" The same thing will happen if a Node-RED \"exec\" node executes that grep command when Node-RED is running in a container. It will see the \"Alpine Linux\" answer. Docker doesn't provide any mechanism for a container to execute an arbitrary command outside of its container. A workaround is to utilise SSH. This remainder of this section explains how to set up the SSH scaffolding so that \"exec\" nodes running in a Node-RED container can invoke arbitrary commands outside container-space. Task Goal \u00b6 Be able to use a Node-RED exec node to perform the equivalent of: $ ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb where: \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb is any host under your control (not just the Raspberry Pi running IOTstack); and \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb is any command known to the target host. Assumptions \u00b6 SensorsIot/IOTstack is installed on your Raspberry Pi. The Node-RED container is running. These instructions are specific to IOTstack but the underlying concepts should apply to any installation of Node-RED in a Docker container. Executing commands \"inside\" a container \u00b6 These instructions make frequent use of the ability to run commands \"inside\" the Node-RED container. For example, suppose you want to execute: $ grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release You have several options: You can do it from the normal Raspberry Pi command line using a Docker command. The basic syntax is: $ docker exec { -it } \u00abcontainerName\u00bb \u00abcommand and parameters\u00bb The actual command you would need would be: $ docker exec nodered grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release Note: The -it flag is optional . It means \"interactive terminal\". Its presence tells Docker that the command may need user interaction, such as entering a password or typing \"yes\" to a question. You can open a shell into the container, run as many commands as you like inside the container, and then exit. For example: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release # whoami # exit $ In words: Run the bash shell inside the Node-RED container. You need to be able to interact with the shell to type commands so the -it flag is required. The \"#\" prompt is coming from bash running inside the container. It also signals that you are running as the root user inside the container. You run the grep , whoami and any other commands. You finish with the exit command (or Control + D ). The \"$\" prompt means you have left the container and are back at the normal Raspberry Pi command line. Run the command from Portainer by selecting the container, then clicking the \">_ console\" link. This is identical to opening a shell. Variable definitions \u00b6 You will need to have a few concepts clear in your mind before you can set up SSH successfully. I use double-angle quote marks (guillemets) to mean \"substitute the appropriate value here\". \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb (required) The name of your Raspberry Pi. When you first booted your RPi, it had the name \"raspberrypi\" but you probably changed it using raspi-config . Example: iot-dev \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb (required) Either or both of the following: \u00abHOSTFQDN\u00bb (optional) If you have a local Domain Name System server, you may have defined a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Raspberry Pi. Example: iot-dev.mydomain.com Note: Docker's internal networks do not support multicast traffic. You can't use a multicast DNS name (eg \"raspberrypi.local\") as a substitute for a fully-qualified domain name. \u00abHOSTIP\u00bb (required) Even if you don't have a fully-qualified domain name, you will still have an IP address for your Raspberry Pi. Example: 192.168.132.9 Keep in mind that a Raspberry Pi running IOTstack is operating as a server . A dynamic DHCP address is not appropriate for a server. The server's IP address needs to be fixed. The two standard approaches are: a static DHCP assignment configured on your DHCP server (eg your router) which always returns the same IP address for a given MAC address; or a static IP address configured on your Raspberry Pi. \u00abUSERID\u00bb (required) The user ID of the account on \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb where you want Node-RED flows to be able to run commands. Example: pi Step 1: Generate SSH key-pair for Node-RED (one time) \u00b6 Create a key-pair for Node-RED. This is done by executing the ssh-keygen command inside the container: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -C \"Node-RED container key-pair\" -N \"\" Notes: The \"ed25519\" elliptic curve algorithm is recommended (generally described as quicker and more secure than RSA) but you can use the default RSA algorithm if you prefer. Respond to the \"Enter file in which to save the key\" prompt by pressing return to accept the default location. If ssh-keygen displays an \"Overwrite (y/n)?\" message, it implies that a key-pair already exists. You will need to decide what to do: press y to overwrite (and lose the old keys) press n to terminate the command, after which you can investigate why a key-pair already exists. Step 2: Exchange keys with target hosts (once per target host) \u00b6 Node-RED's public key needs to be copied to the user account on each target machine where you want a Node-RED \"exec\" node to be able to execute commands. At the same time, the Node-RED container needs to learn the public host key of the target machine. The ssh-copy-id command does both steps. The required syntax is: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb Examples: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.132.9 The output will be something similar to the following: /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \"/root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\" The authenticity of host 'iot-dev.mydomain.com (192.168.132.9)' can't be established. ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:HVoeowZ1WTSG0qggNsnGwDA6acCd/JfVLZsNUv4hjNg. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Respond to the prompt by typing \"yes\" and pressing return . The output continues: /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed expr: warning: '^ERROR: ': using '^' as the first character of a basic regular expression is not portable; it is ignored /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com's password: The response may look like it contains errors but those can be ignored. Enter the password you use to login as \u00abUSERID\u00bb on \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb and press return . Normal completion looks similar to this: Number of key(s) added: 1 Now try logging into the machine, with: \"ssh 'pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com'\" and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added. If you do not see an indication that a key has been added, you may need to retrace your steps. Step 3: Perform the recommended test \u00b6 The output above recommends a test. The test needs to be run inside the Node-RED container so the syntax is: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Examples: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack $ docker exec -it nodered ssh pi@192.168.132.9 ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack You should not be prompted for a password. If you are, you may need to retrace your steps. If everything works as expected, you should see a list of the files in your IOTstack folder. Assuming success, think about what just happened? You told SSH inside the Node-RED container to run the ls command outside the container on your Raspberry Pi. You broke through the containerisation. Understanding what's where and what each file does \u00b6 What files are where \u00b6 Six files are relevant to Node-RED's ability to execute commands outside of container-space: in /etc/ssh : ssh_host_ed25519_key is the Raspberry Pi's private host key ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub is the Raspberry Pi's public host key Those keys were created when your Raspberry Pi was initialised. They are unique to the host. Unless you take precautions, those keys will change whenever your Raspberry Pi is rebuilt from scratch and that will stop SSH from working. You can recover by re-running ssh-copy-id . in ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh : id_ed25519 is the Node-RED container's private key id_ed25519.pub is the Node-RED container's public key Those keys were created when you generated the SSH key-pair for Node-RED. They are unique to Node-RED but will follow the container in backups and will work on the same machine, or other machines, if you restore the backup. It does not matter if the Node-RED container is rebuilt or if a new version of Node-RED comes down from DockerHub. These keys will remain valid until lost or overwritten. If you lose or destroy these keys, SSH will stop working. You can recover by generating new keys and then re-running ssh-copy-id . known_hosts The known_hosts file contains a copy of the Raspberry Pi's public host key. It was put there by ssh-copy-id . If you lose this file or it gets overwritten, SSH will still work but will re-prompt for authorisation to connect. This works when you are running commands from docker exec -it but not when running commands from an exec node. Note that authorising the connection at the command line (\"Are you sure you want to continue connecting?\") will auto-repair the known_hosts file. in ~/.ssh/ : authorized_keys That file contains a copy of the Node-RED container's public key. It was put there by ssh-copy-id . Pay attention to the path. It implies that there is one authorized_keys file per user, per target host. If you lose this file or it gets overwritten, SSH will still work but will ask for the password for \u00abUSERID\u00bb. This works when you are running commands from docker exec -it but not when running commands from an exec node. Note that providing the correct password at the command line will auto-repair the authorized_keys file. What each file does \u00b6 SSH running inside the Node-RED container uses the Node-RED container's private key to provide assurance to SSH running outside the container that it (the Node-RED container) is who it claims to be. SSH running outside container-space verifies that assurance by using its copy of the Node-RED container's public key in authorized_keys . SSH running outside container-space uses the Raspberry Pi's private host key to provide assurance to SSH running inside the Node-RED container that it (the RPi) is who it claims to be. SSH running inside the Node-RED container verifies that assurance by using its copy of the Raspberry Pi's public host key stored in known_hosts . Config file (optional) \u00b6 You don't have to do this step but it will simplify your exec node commands and reduce your maintenance problems if you do. At this point, SSH commands can be executed from inside the container using this syntax: # ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb A config file is needed to achieve the task goal of the simpler syntax: # ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb A config file does not just simplify connection commands. It provides isolation between the \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb and \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb such that you only have a single file to change if your \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb changes (eg new IP address or fully qualified domain name). It also exposes less about your network infrastructure when you share your flows. The goal is to set up this file: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh/config The file needs the ownership and permissions shown. There are several ways of going about this and you are free to choose the one that works for you. The method described here creates the file first, then sets correct ownership and permissions, and then moves the file into place. Start in a directory where you can create a file without needing sudo . The IOTstack folder is just as good as anywhere else: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ touch config Select the following text, copy it to the clipboard. host \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb hostname \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb user \u00abUSERID\u00bb IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 Open ~/IOTstack/config in your favourite text editor and paste the contents of the clipboard. Replace the \u00abdelimited\u00bb keys. Completed examples: If you are using the \u00abHOSTFQDN\u00bb form: host iot-dev hostname iot-dev.mydomain.com user pi IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 If you are using the \u00abHOSTIP\u00bb form: host iot-dev hostname 192.168.132.9 user pi IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 Save the file. Change the config file's ownership and permissions, and move it into the correct directory: $ chmod 644 config $ sudo chown root:root config $ sudo mv config ./volumes/nodered/ssh Re-test with config file in place \u00b6 The previous test used this syntax: $ docker exec nodered ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Now that the config file is in place, the syntax changes to: $ docker exec nodered ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Example: $ docker exec nodered ssh iot-dev ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack The result should be the same as the earlier test. A test flow \u00b6 In the Node-RED GUI: Click the \"+\" to create a new, empty flow. Drag the following nodes onto the canvas: One \"inject\" node Two \"exec\" nodes Two \"debug\" nodes Wire the outlet of the \"inject\" node to the inlet of both \"exec\" nodes. Wire the uppermost \"stdout\" outlet of the first \"exec\" node to the inlet of the first \"debug\" node. Repeat step 4 with the other \"exec\" and \"debug\" node. Open the first \"exec\" node and: set the \"command\" field to: grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release - turn off the \"append msg.payload\" checkbox - set the timeout to a reasonable value (eg 10 seconds) - click \"Done\". 7. Repeat step 6 with the other \"exec\" node, with one difference: - set the \"command\" field to: ssh iot-dev grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release Click the Deploy button. Set the right hand panel to display debug messages. Click the touch panel of the \"inject\" node to trigger the flow. Inspect the result in the debug panel. You should see payload differences similar to the following: PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.11\" PRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\" The first line is the result of running the command inside the Node-RED container. The second line is the result of running the same command outside the Node-RED container on the Raspberry Pi. Suppose you want to add another \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb \u00b6 Exchange keys with the new target host using: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb Edit the config file at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh/config to define the new host. Remember to use sudo to edit the file. There is no need to restart Node-RED or recreate the container. Maintaining Node-RED \u00b6 Starting Node-RED \u00b6 Use these commands to: Start the container; or Re-create the container if you have made a material change to the container's service definition in your Compose file. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d nodered The first time you execute this command, the base image of Node-RED is downloaded from DockerHub, and then the Dockerfile is run to produce a local image. The local image is then instantiated to become the running container. Stopping Node-RED \u00b6 To stop the running container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v nodered Alternatively, you can stop the entire stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down Restarting Node-RED \u00b6 The restart command sends a signal to the processes running within the container. The container itself does not stop. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Re-building the local image \u00b6 You need to rebuild the local image if you do any of the following: Change either of the build arguments ( DOCKERHUB_TAG or EXTRA_PACKAGES ) in your Compose file. Make a material change to your Node-RED Dockerfile , such as re-running the menu to change your selection of add-on nodes. To rebuild your local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d nodered $ docker system prune Think of these commands as \"re-running the Dockerfile \". The only time a base image will be downloaded from DockerHub is when a base* image with a tag matching the value of DOCKERHUB_TAG can't be found on your Raspberry Pi. Your existing Node-RED container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your Node-RED service. Upgrading Node-RED \u00b6 The only way to know when an update to Node-RED is available is to check the nodered/node-red tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Node-RED like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull nodered $ docker-compose up -d nodered $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; nodered is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Node-RED container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your Node-RED service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up old images. Sometimes you need to run this twice, the first time to clean up the old local image, the second time for the old base image. Whether an old base image exists depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Node-RED and node.js versions \u00b6 Checking versions \u00b6 You can use the npm version command to check which versions of Node-RED and node.js are running in your container: $ docker exec nodered npm version { 'node-red-docker': '2.2.2', npm: '6.14.15', ares: '1.18.1', brotli: '1.0.9', cldr: '37.0', http_parser: '2.9.4', icu: '67.1', llhttp: '2.1.4', modules: '72', napi: '8', nghttp2: '1.41.0', node: '12.22.8', openssl: '1.1.1m', tz: '2019c', unicode: '13.0', uv: '1.40.0', v8: '7.8.279.23-node.56', zlib: '1.2.11' } In the above: 'node-red-docker': '2.2.2' indicates that version 2.2.2 of Node-RED is running. This is the version number you see at the bottom of the main menu when you click on the \"hamburger\" icon (\"\u2261\") at the top, right of the Node-Red window in your browser. node: '12.22.8' indicates that version 12.x of node.js is installed. Controlling versions \u00b6 IOTstack uses a service definition for Node-RED that includes these lines: 3 4 5 6 build : context : ./services/nodered/. args : - DOCKERHUB_TAG=latest If you do not see this structure in your Compose file, refer to updating to July 2022 syntax . The value of the DOCKERHUB_TAG gives you the ability to control, from your Compose file, which versions of Node-RED and node.js run within your Node-RED container. The allowable values of DOCKERHUB_TAG can be found on the DockerHub Node-RED tags page . The table below contains examples of tags that were available on DockerHub at the time of writing (2022-07-06): tag Node-RED version node.js version latest 2.2.2 14.x latest-14 2.2.2 14.x \ud83d\udccc 2.2.2 2.2.2 \ud83d\udccc 14.x 2.2.2-14 2.2.2 \ud83d\udccc 14.x \ud83d\udccc Interpreting the tag: The sub-string to the left of the hyphen determines the version of Node-RED: \"latest\" means the most up-to-date version, implying that the actual version number can change any time you follow the process to upgrade Node-RED . \"2.2.2\" pins your container to that specific version of Node-RED, implying that the version number will be frozen until you change the pin. The sub-string to the right of the hyphen determines the version of node.js : \"-14\" refers to node.js version 14.x and pins your container to that specific version of node.js . If the hyphen and suffix are omitted, it implies that the actual version of node.js can change any time you follow the process to upgrade Node-RED . In short: If you pin both sides to specific values (eg \"2.2.2-14\") then all decisions about when to upgrade and which versions to use are under your control; but If you use \"latest\" then all timing and version decisions are under the control of the maintainers of the DockerHub images. IOTstack defaults to \"latest\". Although this appears to cede control to the maintainers of the DockerHub images, in practice it is no different to any other container where you pull its image directly from DockerHub using the latest tag (irrespective of whether latest is explicit or implied by omission). The DOCKERHUB_TAG argument for Node-RED merely gives you the ability to pin to specific versions of Node-RED from within your Compose file, in the same way as you can use tags on image directives for other containers. For example, suppose you wanted to pin to Node-RED version 2.2.2 with node.js version 12: Edit your Compose file so that the DOCKERHUB_TAG looks like this: - DOCKERHUB_TAG=2.2.2-12 Run the re-building the local Node-RED image commands. Changing a pinned version and rebuilding may result in a new base image being downloaded from DockerHub . Node management \u00b6 Installing nodes \u00b6 You can install nodes by: Adjusting the Node-RED Dockerfile . This can be done by: Running the IOTstack menu and changing the selected Node-RED nodes; or Editing your Node-RED Dockerfile using a text editor. Using the IOTstack menu limits your choice of nodes to those presented in the menu. Editing the Dockerfile with a text editor is more flexible but carries the risk that your changes could be lost if you subsequently use the menu method. To apply changes made to your Dockerfile , run the re-building the local Node-RED image commands. Adding, removing or updating nodes in Manage Palette. Node-RED will remind you to restart Node-RED and that is something you have to do by hand: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Note: Some users have reported misbehaviour from Node-RED if they do too many iterations of: [make a single change in Manage Palette] $ docker-compose restart nodered [make a single change in Manage Palette] $ docker-compose restart nodered \u2026 It is better to: [do ALL your Manage Palette changes] $ docker-compose restart nodered Installing nodes inside the container via npm: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # cd /data # npm install \u00abnode-name\u00bb /data # exit $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Note: You must put the /data onto the end of the npm install command. Any formula you find on the web will not include this. You have to remember to do it yourself! See also the note above about restarting too frequently. You can use this approach if you need to force the installation of a specific version (which you don't appear to be able to do in Manage Palette). For example, to install version 4.0.0 of the \"moment\" node: # npm install node-red-contrib-moment@4.0.0 /data There is no real difference between the methods. Some nodes (eg \"node-red-contrib-generic-ble\" and \"node-red-node-sqlite\") must be installed by Dockerfile but the only way of finding out if a node must be installed via Dockerfile is to try Manage Palette and find that it doesn't work. Aside from the exception cases that require Dockerfile or where you need to force a specific version, it is quicker to install nodes via Manage Palette and applying updates is a bit easier too. But it's really up to you. If you're wondering about \"backup\", nodes installed via: Dockerfile \u2013 implicitly backed up when the Dockerfile is backed-up. Manage Palette or npm install \u2013 explicitly backed up when the ~/IOTstack/volumes directory is backed-up. Basically, if you're running IOTstack backups then your add-on nodes will be backed-up. Node precedence \u00b6 Add-on nodes that are installed via Dockerfile wind up at the internal path: /usr/src/node-red/node_modules Add-on nodes installed via Manage Palette wind up at the external path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules The Compose file volumes mapping: ./volumes/nodered/data:/data implies that add-on nodes installed via Manage Palette are made available to Node-RED at the internal path: /data/node_modules Because there are two places, this invites the question of what happens if a given node is installed in both? The answer is that add-ons installed at: /data/node_modules take precedence over those installed at: /usr/src/node-red/node_modules Or, to put it more simply: in any contest, Manage Palette prevails over Dockerfile . Resolving node duplication \u00b6 Sometimes, even when you are 100% certain that you didn't do it, an add-on node will turn up in both places. There is probably some logical reason for this but I don't know what it is. The problem this creates is that a later version of an add-on node installed via Dockerfile will be blocked by the presence of an older version of that node in: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules The nodered_list_installed_nodes.sh script helps discover when this situation exists. For example: $ ~/IOTstack/scripts/nodered_list_installed_nodes.sh Nodes installed by Dockerfile INSIDE the container at /usr/src/node-red/node_modules ACTIVE: node-red-admin ACTIVE: node-red-configurable-ping ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-boolean-logic ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-generic-ble ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-influxdb ACTIVE: node-red-dashboard BLOCKED: node-red-node-email ACTIVE: node-red-node-pi-gpiod ACTIVE: node-red-node-rbe ACTIVE: node-red-node-sqlite ACTIVE: node-red-node-tail Nodes installed by \u00abManage Palette\u00bb OUTSIDE the container at /home/pi/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules node-red-contrib-boolean-logic-ultimate node-red-contrib-chartjs node-red-node-email node-red-contrib-md5 node-red-contrib-moment node-red-contrib-pushsafer Notice how node-red-node-email appears in both lists. To fix this problem: Move into the correct external directory: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules Create a sub-directory to be the equivalent of a local trash can: $ sudo mkdir duplicates Move each duplicate node into the duplicates directory. For example, to move node-red-node-email you would: $ sudo mv node-red-node-email duplicates Tell Node-RED to restart. This causes it to forget about the nodes which have just been moved out of the way: $ docker-compose -f ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml restart nodered Finish off by erasing the duplicates folder: $ sudo rm -rf duplicates Always be extremely careful with any rm -rf , particularly when it is coupled with a sudo . Double-check your work before you press return . Package management \u00b6 As well as providing the Node-RED service, the nodered container is an excellent testbed. Installing the DNS tools, Mosquitto clients and tcpdump will help you to figure out what is going on inside container-space. There are two ways to add extra packages. The first method is to add them to the running container. For example, to add the Mosquitto clients: $ docker exec nodered apk add --no-cache mosquitto-clients The \"apk\" implies that the Node-RED container is based on Alpine Linux. Keep that in mind when you search for instructions on installing packages. Packages installed this way will persist until the container is re-created (eg a down and up of the stack, or a reboot of your Raspberry Pi). This is a good choice if you only want to run a quick experiment. The second method adds the packages to your local image every time you rebuild. Because the packages are in the local image, they are always in the running container. For example, to include the Mosquitto clients in every build: Edit your Compose file to include the package on the EXTRA_PACKAGES argument: - EXTRA_PACKAGES=mosquitto-clients If you do not see the EXTRA_PACKAGES argument in your Compose file, refer to updating to July 2022 syntax . Rebuild your local image by running the re-building the local Node-RED image commands. You can specify multiple packages on the same line. For example: - EXTRA_PACKAGES=mosquitto-clients bind-tools tcpdump Notes: Use a space to separate package names. Do not encapsulate the list in quote marks. Updating to July 2022 syntax \u00b6 The primary benefit of the new syntax is that you no longer risk the IOTstack menu overwriting any custom changes you may have made to your Node-RED Dockerfile . If you install a clean copy of IOTstack, run the menu, enable Node-RED and select one or more add-on nodes then both your Compose file and Dockerfile will use the latest syntax automatically. If you have an older version of IOTstack installed, the syntax used in your Compose file and Dockerfile will depend on when you last ran the menu and manipulated Node-RED. To avoid any uncertainties, you can use a text editor to update your existing Compose file and Dockerfile to adopt the latest syntax. Updating your Compose file \u00b6 Step 1: Implement the new syntactic scaffolding: The first three lines of the old syntax are: 1 2 3 nodered : container_name : nodered build : ./services/nodered/. Replace line 3 (the one-line build: directive) with the following lines: 3 4 5 6 7 build : context : ./services/nodered/. args : - DOCKERHUB_TAG=latest - EXTRA_PACKAGES= Step 2: Pin to the desired version (optional): If your existing Dockerfile pins to a specific version, edit the value of DOCKERHUB_TAG (line 6 of your updated Compose file) to use the tag from your Dockerfile . For example, if your existing Dockerfile begins with: FROM nodered/node-red:latest-12 then line 6 of your Compose file should be: 6 - DOCKERHUB_TAG=latest-12 Note: IOTstack switched to latest-12 in March 2021. The default for July 2022 syntax is latest . At the time of writing, that is the same as latest-14 , which is what is recommended by Node-RED. If any of your flows has a dependence on node.js version 12 (or if you do not want to take the risk), use latest-12 . Step 3: Define extra packages (optional): If your existing Dockerfile includes extra packages, edit the value of EXTRA_PACKAGES (line 7 of your updated Compose file) to list the same packages. For example, if your existing Dockerfile includes: RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache eudev-dev mosquitto-clients bind-tools tcpdump then everything after eudev-dev should appear on line 7 of your Compose file: 6 - EXTRA_PACKAGES=mosquitto-clients bind-tools tcpdump Notes: use spaces between package names. do not enclose the list of packages in quotes. do not include eudev-dev (it is specified in the updated Dockerfile ). Updating your Dockerfile \u00b6 The first four lines of your existing Dockerfile will have a structure similar to this: 1 2 3 4 FROM nodered/node-red:latest-12 USER root RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache eudev-dev USER node-red The actual text will depend on whether you have modified the tag in the first line or added extra packages to the third line. Replace the first four lines of your Dockerfile with the following lines: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 # reference argument - omitted defaults to latest ARG DOCKERHUB_TAG = latest # Download base image FROM nodered/node-red:${DOCKERHUB_TAG} # reference argument - omitted defaults to null ARG EXTRA_PACKAGES ENV EXTRA_PACKAGES = ${ EXTRA_PACKAGES } # default user is node-red - need to be root to install packages USER root # install packages RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache eudev-dev ${ EXTRA_PACKAGES } # switch back to default user USER node-red # variable not needed inside running container ENV EXTRA_PACKAGES = # add-on nodes follow All remaining lines of your original Dockerfile should be left as-is.

In either case, the path ./services/nodered/. tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile which contains instructions to download a base image from DockerHub and then apply local customisations such as the add-on nodes you chose in the IOTstack menu.

This presents a problem if you want write to a file outside a container, then read from it inside the container, or vice-versa. IOTstack containers have been set up with shared volume mappings. Each volume mapping associates a specific directory in the Raspberry Pi file system with a specific directory inside the container. If you write to files in a shared directory (or one of its sub-directories), both the host and the container can see the same sub-directories and files. Key point: Files and directories in the shared volume are persistent between restarts. If you save your data anywhere else inside the container, it will be lost when the container is rebuilt. The Node-RED service definition in the Compose file includes the following: volumes : - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data That decomposes into: external path = ./volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data The leading \".\" on the external path implies \"the folder containing the Compose file so it actually means: external path = ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data If you write to the internal path from inside the Node-RED container, the Raspberry Pi will see the results at the external path, and vice versa.

A Debug node. When this node runs, it displays the payload in the debug window on the right hand side of the Node-RED GUI. A File node. The \"Filename\" field of the node is set to write to the path: /data/flow-example.txt When this node runs, it writes the payload to the specified file.

To help you understand the difference, consider this command: $ grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release When you run that command on a Raspberry Pi outside container-space, the answer will be something like: PRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\" If you run the same command inside a Node-RED container, the output will reflect the operating system upon which the container is based, such as: PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.11\" The same thing will happen if a Node-RED \"exec\" node executes that grep command when Node-RED is running in a container. It will see the \"Alpine Linux\" answer. Docker doesn't provide any mechanism for a container to execute an arbitrary command outside of its container. A workaround is to utilise SSH.

Rebuild your local image by running the re-building the local Node-RED image commands. You can specify multiple packages on the same line. For example: - EXTRA_PACKAGES=mosquitto-clients bind-tools tcpdump Notes: Use a space to separate package names.

If you have an older version of IOTstack installed, the syntax used in your Compose file and Dockerfile will depend on when you last ran the menu and manipulated Node-RED.

The /dev/ttyAMA0 device is used as a default because it is always present on Raspbian. If you bring up your container like that, the mapping will succeed and the container is unlikely to go into a restart loop. However, the OctoPrint container is unlikely to be able to connect to your 3D printer via /dev/ttyAMA0 for the very simple reason that that is not how 3D printers usually appear on the Raspberry Pi. You need to work out how your printer presents itself and change the device mapping accordingly. option 1 - /dev/ttyUSBn \u00b6 Using \"ttyUSBn\" will \"work\" but, because of the inherent variability in the name, this approach is not recommended. The \"n\" in the \"ttyUSBn\" can vary depending on which USB devices are attached to your Raspberry Pi and the order in which they are attached. The \"n\" may also change as you add and remove devices. If the OctoPrint container is up when the device number changes, the container will crash, and it will either go into a restart loop if you try to bring it up when the expected device is not \"there\", or will try to communicate with a device that isn't your 3D printer. option 2 - /dev/serial/by-id/xxxxxxxx \u00b6 The \"xxxxxxxx\" is (usually) unique to your 3D printer. To find it, connect your printer to your Raspberry Pi, then run the command: $ ls -1 /dev/serial/by-id You will get an answer like this: usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_3b14eaa48a154d5e87032d59459d5206-if00-port0 Note: If you have multiple serial devices attached, you will get multiple lines in the output. It is up to you to sort out which one belongs to your 3D printer, possibly by disconnecting and re-attaching the printer and observing how the list changes. The uniqueness of device IDs is under the control of the device manufacturer. Each manufacturer should ensure their devices are unique but some manufacturers are more diligent than others. Assuming the above example output was the answer, edit docker-compose.yml to look like this: devices : - /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_3b14eaa48a154d5e87032d59459d5206-if00-port0:/dev/ttyACM0 Notes: device by-id names follow the device. In other words, if you have two or more Raspberry Pis and a collection of serial devices (3D printers, Zigbee adapters, UARTs, and so on), a 3D printer will always get the same by-id name, irrespective of which Raspberry Pi it is attached to. device by-id names do not persist if the physical device is disconnected. If you switch off your 3D printer or disconnect the USB cable while the OctoPrint container is running, the container will crash. option 3 - /dev/humanReadableName \u00b6 Suppose your 3D printer is a MasterDisaster5000Pro, and that you would like to be able to set up the device to use a human-readable name like: /dev/MasterDisaster5000Pro Start by disconnecting your 3D printer from your Raspberry Pi. Next, run this command: $ tail -f /var/log/messages Connect your 3D printer and observe the log output. You are interested in messages that look like this: mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [423839.626522] cp210x 1-1.1.3:1.0: device disconnected mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431265.973308] usb 1-1.1.3: new full-speed USB device number 10 using dwc_otg mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.109418] usb 1-1.1.3: New USB device found, idVendor=dead, idProduct=beef, bcdDevice= 1.00 mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.109439] usb 1-1.1.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3 mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.109456] usb 1-1.1.3: Product: CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.109471] usb 1-1.1.3: Manufacturer: Silicon Labs mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.109486] usb 1-1.1.3: SerialNumber: cafe80facefeed mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.110657] cp210x 1-1.1.3:1.0: cp210x converter detected mmm dd hh:mm:ss mypi kernel: [431266.119225] usb 1-1.1.3: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0 and, in particular, these two lines: \u2026 New USB device found, idVendor=dead, idProduct=beef, bcdDevice= 1.00 \u2026 SerialNumber: cafe80facefeed Terminate the tail command by pressing Control+C. Use this line as a template: SUBSYSTEM==\"tty\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"\u00abidVendor\u00bb\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"\u00abidProduct\u00bb\", ATTRS{serial}==\"\u00abSerialNumber\u00bb\", SYMLINK+=\"\u00absensibleName\u00bb\" Replace the \u00abdelimited\u00bb values with those you see in the log output. For example, given the above log output, and the desire to associate your 3D printer with the human-readable name of \"MasterDisaster5000Pro\", the result would be: SUBSYSTEM==\"tty\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"dead\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"beef\", ATTRS{serial}==\"cafe80facefeed\", SYMLINK+=\"MasterDisaster5000Pro\" Next, ensure the required file exists by executing the following command: $ sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules If the file does not exist already, the touch command creates an empty file, owned by root, with mode 644 (rw-r--r--) permissions (all of which are correct). Use sudo and your favourite text editor to edit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules and insert the \"SUBSYSTEM==\" line you prepared earlier into that file, then save the file. Rules files are read on demand so there is no start or reload command to execute. Check your work by disconnecting, then re-connecting your 3D printer, and then run: $ ls /dev You should expect to see the human-readable name you chose in the list of devices. You can then edit docker-compose.yml to use the name in the device mapping. devices : - /dev/MasterDisaster5000Pro:/dev/ttyACM0 Notes: device names follow the device. In other words, if you have two or more Raspberry Pis and a collection of serial devices (3D printers, Zigbee adapters, UARTs, and so on), you can build a single 99-usb-serial.rules file that you install on all of your Raspberry Pis. Then, you can attach a named device to any of your Raspberry Pis and it will always get the same name. device names do not persist if the physical device is disconnected. If you switch off your 3D printer or disconnect the USB cable while the OctoPrint container is running, the container will crash. the /dev/video0:/dev/video0 mapping \u00b6 The /dev/video0 device is assumed to be an official Raspberry Pi camera attached via ribbon cable. See the Webcams topic of the Octoprint Community Forum for help configuring other kinds of cameras. The OctoPrint docker image includes an MJPG streamer. You do not need to run another container with a streamer unless you want to. To activate a Raspberry Pi camera attached via ribbon cable: Follow the instructions at raspberrypi.org to connect and test the camera. There are guides on YouTube ( example ) if you need help working out how to insert the ribbon cable. Confirm the presence of /dev/video0 . Edit docker-compose.yml and uncomment all of the commented-out lines in the following: devices : # - /dev/video0:/dev/video0 environment : # - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true # - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y # - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 Note: The device path on the right hand side of the CAMERA_DEV environment variable corresponds with the right hand side (ie after the colon) of the device mapping. There should be no reason to change either. The three environment variables are required: environment : - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 The \"640x480\" MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT settings will probably result in your camera feed being \"letterboxed\" but they will get you started. A full list of options is at mjpg-streamer-configuration-options . The typical specs for a baseline Raspberry Pi camera are: 1080p 720p 5Mp Webcam Max resolution: 2592x1944 Max frame rate: VGA 90fps, 1080p 30fps CODEC: MJPG H.264 AVC For that type of camera, the following is probably more appropriate: - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 1152x648 -f 10 The resolution of 1152x648 is 60% of 1080p 1920x1080 and does not cause letterboxing. The resolution and rate of 10 frames per second won't over-tax your communications links, and the camera is MJPEG-capable so it does not need the -y option. Practical usage \u00b6 starting the OctoPrint container \u00b6 To start a print session: Turn the 3D printer on. Bring up the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d octoprint If you try to start the OctoPrint container before your 3D printer has been switched on and the USB interface has registered with the Raspberry Pi, the container will go into a restart loop. first run \u2013 the Setup Wizard \u00b6 Use a browser to point to port 9980 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:9980 This will launch the \"Setup Wizard\". Click the \"Next\" button until you reach the \"Access Control\" screen: Define a Username and Password, and keep a record of your decisions. Click \"Create Account\". Ignore the alarming popup alert by clicking \"Ignore\". This alert is a result of OctoPrint running in a Docker container. Click \"Next\". At the \"Online Connectivity Check\" screen: Click \"Disable Connectivity Check\". Click \"Next\". At the \"Configure Anonymous Usage Tracking\" and \"Configure plugin blacklist processing\" screens: Make a decision about whether you want the feature enabled or disabled and click the appropriate button. Click \"Next\". At the \"Set up your printer profile\" screen: It is probably a good idea to visit the tabs and set values appropriate to your printer (build volume, at least). Click \"Next\". At the \"Server Commands\" screen: Enter the following in the \"Restart OctoPrint\" field: s6-svc -r /var/run/s6/services/octoprint Click \"Next\". At the \"Webcam & Timelapse Recordings\" screen, and assuming you are configuring a PiCamera: Enter the following in the \"Stream URL\" field: /webcam/?action=stream Click the \"Test\" button to confirm that the camera is working, then click \"Close\". Enter the following in the \"Snapshot URL\" field: http://localhost:8080/?action=snapshot Click the \"Test\" button to confirm that the camera is working, then click \"Close\". Enter the following in the \"Path to FFMPEG\" field: /usr/bin/ffmpeg The expected result is the message \"The path is valid\". Click \"Next\". Click \"Finish\" then click the button to reload the user interface. after the first run \u00b6 Use a browser to point to port 9980 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:9980 Supply your user credentials and login. popup messages \u00b6 OctoPrint will display numerous messages in popup windows. These generally fall into two categories: Messages that refer to updates; and Messages that refer to other events. In general, you can ignore messages about updates. You will get all updates automatically the next time the octoprint-docker container is rebuilt and pushed to DockerHub. You can, if you wish, allow an update to proceed. It might be appropriate to do that if you want to test an update. Just be aware that: Updates are ephemeral and will disappear the next time the Octoprint container is created. Updates can change the structure of the persistent storage area in a way which can't be undone, and which may prevent the Octoprint container from starting the next time it is created. In other words, if you want to trial an update, take a backup of OctoPrint's persistent storage area first . restarting the OctoPrint container \u00b6 You can restart the OctoPrint service in two ways: via the Raspberry Pi command line; or via the OctoPrint user interface. Whichever method you choose will result in a refresh of the OctoPrint user interface and you will need to follow the prompts to reload your browser page. restarting via the command line \u00b6 Run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart octoprint restarting via OctoPrint user interface \u00b6 From the \"System\" icon in the OctoPrint toolbar (looks like a power button symbol): Choose \"Restart OctoPrint\". Note: If you do not see the \"System\" icon in the toolbar, fix it line this: Click the \"Settings\" icon (looks like a wrench) in the OctoPrint toolbar. Choose \"Server\". Enter the following into the \"Restart OctoPrint\" field: s6-svc -r /var/run/s6/services/octoprint Click \"Save\". stopping the OctoPrint container \u00b6 Unless you intend to leave your printer switched on 24 hours a day, you will also need to be careful when you switch off the printer: Terminate the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint Turn the 3D printer off. If you turn the printer off without terminating the container, you will crash the container. Video feed (built-in camera interface) \u00b6 You can view the video feed independently of the OctoPrint web interface like this: http://raspberrypi.local:9980/webcam/?action=stream Silencing the security warning \u00b6 OctoPrint assumes it is running \"natively\" rather than in a container. From a data-communications perspective, OctoPrint (the process running inside the OctoPrint container) sees itself as running on a computer attached to the internal Docker network. When you connect to OctoPrint's web interface from a client device attached to an external network, OctoPrint sees that your source IP address is not on the internal Docker network and it issues a security warning. To silence the warning: Terminate the container if it is running: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint use sudo and your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/octoprint/octoprint/config.yaml Implement the following pattern: server : \u2026 ipCheck : enabled : true trustedSubnets : - 203.0.132.0/24 Notes: The server: , ipCheck: and enabled: directives may already be in place but the trustedSubnets: directive may not be. Add it, and then add your local subnet(s) where you see the \"192.168.1.0/24\" example. Remember to use spaces in YAML files. Do not use tabs. Save the file. Bring up the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d octoprint Routine container maintenance \u00b6 You can check for updates like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull octoprint $ docker-compose up -d octoprint $ docker system prune If you forget your username and password \u00b6 You can view a list of usernames like this: $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user list To reset a user's password: Use the following line as a template and replace \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb with appropriate values: $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user password --password \u00abpassword\u00bb \u00abusername\u00bb Execute the edited command. For example, to set the password for user \"me\" to \"verySecure\": $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user password --password verySecure me Restart OctoPrint: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart octoprint Note: OctoPrint supports more than one username. To explore the further: $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user --help If all else fails\u2026 \u00b6 If the OctoPrint container seems to be misbehaving, you can get a \"clean slate\" by: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/octoprint $ docker-compose up -d octoprint The OctoPrint container is well-behaved and will re-initialise its persistent storage area correctly. OctoPrint will adopt \"first run\" behaviour and display the Setup Wizard.","title":"Octoprint"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#octoprint-the-snappy-web-interface-for-your-3d-printer","text":"","title":"OctoPrint \u2013 the snappy web interface for your 3D printer"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#references","text":"OctoPrint home page OctoPrint Community Forum DockerHub octoprint/octoprint GitHub OctoPrint/octoprint-docker","title":"References"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#device-mappings","text":"When you select \"OctoPrint\" in the IOTstack menu, the service definition in your docker-compose.yml , contains the following under the devices: heading: devices : - /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 # - /dev/video0:/dev/video0","title":"Device mappings"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#the-devttyama0devttyacm0-mapping","text":"The /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 mapping should be read as saying \"the physical Raspberry Pi device /dev/ttyAMA0 is mapped to the logical OctoPrint container device /dev/ttyACM0 \".

Edit docker-compose.yml and uncomment all of the commented-out lines in the following: devices : # - /dev/video0:/dev/video0 environment : # - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true # - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y # - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 Note: The device path on the right hand side of the CAMERA_DEV environment variable corresponds with the right hand side (ie after the colon) of the device mapping. There should be no reason to change either. The three environment variables are required: environment : - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 The \"640x480\" MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT settings will probably result in your camera feed being \"letterboxed\" but they will get you started. A full list of options is at mjpg-streamer-configuration-options . The typical specs for a baseline Raspberry Pi camera are: 1080p 720p 5Mp Webcam Max resolution: 2592x1944 Max frame rate: VGA 90fps, 1080p 30fps CODEC: MJPG H.264 AVC For that type of camera, the following is probably more appropriate: - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 1152x648 -f 10 The resolution of 1152x648 is 60% of 1080p 1920x1080 and does not cause letterboxing. The resolution and rate of 10 frames per second won't over-tax your communications links, and the camera is MJPEG-capable so it does not need the -y option.","title":"the /dev/video0:/dev/video0 mapping"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#practical-usage","text":"","title":"Practical usage"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#starting-the-octoprint-container","text":"To start a print session: Turn the 3D printer on.

References \u00b6 Pi-hole on GitHub Pi-hole on Dockerhub Pi-hole environment variables Environment variables \u00b6 In conjunction with controls in Pi-hole's web GUI, environment variables govern much of Pi-hole's behaviour. If you are running new menu (master branch), the variables are inline in docker-compose.yml . If you are running old menu, the variables will be in ~/IOTstack/services/pihole/pihole.env There is nothing about old menu which requires the variables to be stored in the pihole.env file. You can migrate everything to docker-compose.yml if you wish. Pi-hole's authoritative list of environment variables can be found here . Although many of Pi-hole's options can be set through its web GUI, there are two key advantages to using environment variables: If you ever need to reset Pi-hole by erasing its persistent storage area , configuration options set using environment variables will persist while those set through the GUI may be lost; and On at least two occasions in its history, Pi-hole upgrades have had the effect of wiping configuration options set through the GUI, whereas options set using environment variables survived. Admin password \u00b6 The first time Pi-hole is launched, it checks for the WEBPASSWORD environment variable. If found, the right hand side becomes the administrative password. You can set the value of WEBPASSWORD in the IOTstack menu by: Placing the cursor on top of \"pihole\". If Pi-hole is not already selected as a container, press space to select it. Press the right arrow, and then Choose \"PiHole Password Options\". From there, you have the choice of: Use default password for this build Choosing this option results in: - WEBPASSWORD=IOtSt4ckP1Hol3 Randomise password for this build Choosing this option results in a randomly-generated password which you can find by inspecting your docker-compose.yml . Do nothing Choosing this option results in: - WEBPASSWORD=%randomAdminPassword% which is a valid password string so \"%randomAdminPassword%\" will become the password. Regardless of which option you choose, you can always edit your docker-compose.yml to change the value of the environment variable. For example: - WEBPASSWORD=mybigsecret It is important to realise that WEBPASSWORD only has any effect on the very first launch. Once Pi-hole has been run at least once, the value of WEBPASSWORD is ignored and any changes you make will have no effect. If WEBPASSWORD is not set on first launch, Pi-hole defaults to a randomly-generated password which you can discover after the first launch like this: $ docker logs pihole | grep random Remember, docker logs are ephemeral so you need to run that command before the log disappears! If you ever need to reset Pi-hole's admin password to a known value, use the following command: $ docker exec pihole pihole -a -p mybigsecret replacing \"mybigsecret\" with your choice of password. Other variables \u00b6 Most of Pi-hole's environment variables are self-explanatory but some can benefit from elaboration. (advanced) reverse DNS query handling First, understand that there are two basic types of DNS query: forward queries : question: \"what is the IP address of fred.yourdomain.com?\" answer: 192.168.1.100 reverse queries : question: \"what is the domain name for 192.168.1.100?\" answer: fred.yourdomain.com Pi-hole has its own built-in DNS server which can answer both kinds of queries. The implementation is useful but doesn't offer all the features of a full-blown DNS server like BIND9. If you decide to implement a more capable DNS server to work alongside Pi-hole, you will need to understand the following Pi-hole environment variables: REV_SERVER= If you configure Pi-hole's built-in DNS server to be authoritative for your local domain name, REV_SERVER=false is appropriate, in which case none of the variables discussed below has any effect. Setting REV_SERVER=true allows Pi-hole to forward queries that it can't answer to a local upstream DNS server, typically running inside your network. REV_SERVER_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com (where \"yourdomain.com\" is an example) The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the domain of the local network router\". The words \"if conditional forwarding is enabled\" mean \"when REV_SERVER=true \". However, this option really has little-to-nothing to do with the \"domain of the local network router \". Your router may have an IP address that reverse-resolves to a local domain name (eg gateway.mydomain.com) but this is something most routers are unaware of, even if you have configured your router's DHCP server to inform clients that they should assume a default domain of \"yourdomain.com\". This variable actually tells Pi-hole the name of your local domain. In other words, it tells Pi-hole to consider the possibility that an unqualified name like \"fred\" could be the fully-qualified domain name \"fred.yourdomain.com\". REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.5 (where 192.168.1.5 is an example): The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the IP of the local network router\". This option tells Pi-hole where to direct forward queries that it can't answer. In other words, Pi-hole will send a forward query for fred.yourdomain.com to 192.168.1.5. It may be appropriate to set REV_SERVER_TARGET to the IP address of your router (eg 192.168.1.1) but, unless your router is running as a DNS server (not impossible but uncommon), the router will likely just relay any queries to your ISP's DNS servers (or other well-known DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 if you have configured those). Those external DNS servers are unlikely to be able to resolve queries for names in your private domain, and won't be able to do anything sensible with reverse queries if your home network uses RFC1918 addressing (which most do: 182.168.x.x being the most common example). Forwarding doesn't guarantee that 192.168.1.5 will be able to answer the query. The DNS server at 192.168.1.5 may well relay the query to yet another server. In other words, this environment variable does no more than set the next hop. If you are planning on using this option, the target needs to be a DNS server that is authoritative for your local domain and that, pretty much, is going to be a local upstream DNS server inside your home network like another Raspberry Pi running BIND9. REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.1.0/24 (where 192.168.1.0/24 is an example) The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the reverse DNS zone (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)\". This is correct but it lacks detail. The string \"192.168.1.0/24\" defines your local subnet using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Most home subnets use a subnet-mask of 255.255.255.0. If you write that out in binary, it is 24 1-bits followed by 8 0-bits, as in: 255 . 255 . 255 . 0 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 Those 24 one-bits are where the /24 comes from in 192.168.1.0/24 . When you perform a bitwise logical AND between that subnet mask and 192.168.1.0, the \".0\" is removed (conceptually), as in: 192.168.1.0 AND 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.1 What it means is: The network prefix is \"192.168.1\". This host on the 192.168.1 network is the reserved address \"192.168.1.0\". It is better to think of this as \"the network prefix followed by all-zero bits in the host portion\". It is not common to see the .0 address used in practice. A device either knows its IP address or it doesn't. If it doesn't then it won't know its prefix so it will use 0.0.0.0 as a substitute for \"this\". The range of IP addresses available for allocation to hosts on this subnet is 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254 inclusive. All hosts on the 192.168.1 network (ie broadcast) is the reserved address \"192.168.1.255\". It is better to think of this as \"the network prefix followed by all-one bits in the host portion\". When you set REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.1.0/24 you are telling Pi-hole that reverse queries for the host range 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254 should be sent to the REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.5 . Pi-hole Web GUI \u00b6 Note: in order for Web GUI settings to have any effects, you need to configure the RPi or other machines to use it. This is described in the next topics. Connecting to the GUI \u00b6 Point your browser to: http://\u00abyour_ip\u00bb:8089/admin where \u00abyour_ip\u00bb can be: The IP address of the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole. The domain name of the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole. The multicast DNS name (eg \"raspberrypi.local\") of the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole. Adding local domain names \u00b6 Login to the Pi-hole web interface: http://raspberrypi.local:8089/admin : Select from Left menu: Local DNS -> DNS Records Enter Domain: raspberrypi.home.arpa and the RPi's IP Address, e.g. 192.168.1.10 . Press Add. Now you can use raspberrypi.home.arpa as the domain name for the Raspberry Pi in your whole local network. You can also add domain names for your other devices, provided they too have static IPs. why .home.arpa? Instead of .home.arpa - which is the real standard, but a mouthful - you can use .internal . Using .local would technically work, but it should be reserved for mDNS use only. Configure the Raspberry Pi to use Pi-hole \u00b6 The Raspberry Pi itself does not have to use the Pi-hole container for its own DNS services. Some chicken-and-egg situations can exist if, for example, the Pi-hole container is down when another process (eg apt or docker-compose ) needs to do something that depends on DNS services being available. Nevertheless, if you configure Pi-hole to be local DNS resolver, then you will probably want to configure your Raspberry Pi to use the Pi-hole container in the first instance, and then fall back to a public DNS server if the container is down. As a beginner, this is probably what you want regardless. Do this by running the commands: $ echo \"name_servers=127.0.0.1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ echo \"name_servers_append=8.8.8.8\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ echo \"resolv_conf_local_only=NO\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ sudo resolvconf -u This results in a configuration that will continue working, even if the Pi-hole container isn't running. Detailed explanations of these commands name_servers=127.0.0.1 instructs the Raspberry Pi to direct DNS queries to the loopback address. Port 53 is implied. If the Pi-hole container is running in: non-host mode, Docker is listening to port 53 and forwards the queries to the Pi-hole container; host mode, the Pi-hole container is listening to port 53. name_servers_append=8.8.8.8 instructs the Raspberry Pi to fail-over to 8.8.8.8 if Pi-hole does not respond. You can replace 8.8.8.8 (a Google service) with: Another well-known public DNS server like 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare). The IP address(es) of your ISP's DNS hosts (generally available from your ISP's web site). The IP address of another DNS server running in your local network (eg BIND9). The IP address of your home router. Most home routers default to the ISP's DNS hosts but you can usually change your router's configuration to bypass your ISP in favour of public servers like 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. You need slightly different syntax if you want to add multiple fallback servers. For example, suppose your fallback hosts are a local server (eg 192.168.1.2) running BIND9 and 8.8.8.8. The command would be: $ echo 'name_servers_append=\"192.168.1.2 8.8.8.8\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf resolv_conf_local_only=NO is needed so that 127.0.0.1 and 8.8.8.8 can coexist. The resolvconf -u command instructs Raspberry Pi OS to rebuild the active resolver configuration. In principle, that means parsing /etc/resolvconf.conf to derive /etc/resolv.conf . This command can sometimes return the error \"Too few arguments\". You should ignore that error. flowchart LR RERECONF[\"/etc/resolvconf.conf\"] --- UP([resolvconf -u]) DHCP[DHCP provided DNS-server] --- UP UP -- \"generates\" --> RECONF[\"/etc/resolv.conf\"] classDef command fill:#9996,stroke-width:0px class UP command Advanced options: ignoring DHCP provided DNS-servers, local domain name search If you wish to prevent the Raspberry Pi from including the address(es) of DNS servers learned from DHCP, you can instruct the DHCP client running on the Raspberry Pi to ignore the information coming from the DHCP server: $ echo 'nooption domain_name_servers' | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcpcd.conf $ sudo service dhcpcd reload $ sudo resolvconf -u If you have followed the steps in Adding local domain names to define names for your local hosts, you can inform the Raspberry Pi of that fact like this: $ echo 'search_domains=home.arpa' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ sudo resolvconf -u That will add the following line to /etc/resolv.conf : search home.arpa Then, when you refer to a host by a short name (eg \"fred\") the Raspberry Pi will also consider \"fred.home.arpa\" when trying to discover the IP address. Interaction with other containers Docker provides a special IP 127.0.0.11, which listens to DNS queries and resolves them according to the host RPi's resolv.conf. Containers usually rely on this to perform DNS lookups. This is nice as it won't present any surprises as DNS lookups on both the host and in the containers will yeild the same results. It's possible to make DNS queries directly cross-container, and even supported in some rare use-cases . Configure Pi-hole as your local DNS resolver \u00b6 To use the Pi-hole in your LAN, you need to assign the RPi a fixed IP-address and configure this IP as your DNS server. 1. Assign the RPi a fixed IP address \u00b6 If you want clients on your network to use Pi-hole for their DNS, the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole must have a fixed IP address. It does not have to be a static IP address (in the sense of being hard-coded into the Raspberry Pi). The Raspberry Pi can still obtain its IP address from DHCP at boot time, providing your DHCP server (usually your home router) always returns the same IP address. This is usually referred to as a static binding and associates the Raspberry Pi's MAC address with a fixed IP address. Keep in mind that many Raspberry Pis have both Ethernet and WiFi interfaces. It is generally prudent to establish static bindings for both network interfaces in your DHCP server. You can use the following command to discover the MAC addresses for your Raspberry Pi's Ethernet and WiFi interfaces: $ for I in eth0 wlan0 ; do ip link show $I ; done 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 link/ether dc:a6:32:4c:89:f9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 link/ether e5:4f:01:41:88:b2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff In the above: The MAC address of the Ethernet interface is \"dc:a6:32:4c:89:f9\" The MAC address of the WiFi interface is \"e5:4f:01:41:88:b2\" If a physical interface does not exist, the command returns \"Device does not exist\" for that interface. If you prefer, you can also substitute the ifconfig command for ip link show . It's just a little more wordy. 2. Configuring other machines to use the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole \u00b6 In order for Pi-hole to block ads or resolve anything, clients need to be told to use it as their DNS server. You can either: Adopt a whole-of-network approach and edit the DNS settings in your DHCP server so that all clients are given the IP address of the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole to use for DNS services when a lease is issued. Adopt a case-by-case (manual) approach where you instruct particular clients to obtain DNS services from the IP address of the Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole. Option 1 (whole-of-network) is the simplest approach. Assuming your Raspberry Pi has the static IP 192.168.1.10 : Go to your network's DHCP server. In most home networks, this will be your Wireless Access Point/WLAN Router: Login into its web-interface Find where DNS servers are defined (generally with DHCP controls) Change all DNS fields to 192.168.1.10 All local clients have to be rebooted. Without this they will continue to use the old DNS setting from an old DHCP lease for quite some time. Option 2 (case-by-case) generally involves finding the IP configuration options for each host and setting the DNS server manually. Manual changes are usually effective immediately without needing a reboot. advanced configurations Setting up a combination of Pi-hole (for ad-blocking services), and/or a local upstream DNS resolver (eg BIND9) to be authoritative for a local domain and reverse-resolution for your local IP addresses, and decisions about where each DNS server forwards queries it can't answer (eg your ISP's DNS servers, or Google's 8.8.8.8, or Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1) is a complex topic and depends on your specific needs. The same applies to setting up a DHCP server (eg DHCPD) which is capable of distinguishing between the various clients on your network (ie by MAC address) to make case-by-case decisions as to where each client should obtain its DNS services. If you need help, try asking questions on the IOTstack Discord channel . Testing and Troubleshooting \u00b6 Make these assumptions: You have followed the instructions above to add these lines to /etc/resolvconf.conf : name_servers=127.0.0.1 name_servers_append=8.8.8.8 resolv_conf_local_only=NO The Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole has the IP address 192.168.1.10 which it obtains as a static assignment from your DHCP server. You have configured your DHCP server to provide 192.168.1.10 for client devices to use to obtain DNS services (ie, you are saying clients should use Pi-hole for DNS). The result of the configuration appears in /etc/resolv.conf : $ cat /etc/resolv.conf # Generated by resolvconf nameserver 127.0.0.1 nameserver 192.168.1.10 nameserver 8.8.8.8 Interpretation: nameserver 127.0.0.1 is present because of name_servers=127.0.0.1 nameserver 192.168.1.10 is present because it was learned from DHCP nameserver 8.8.8.8 is present because of name_servers_append=8.8.8.8 The fact that the Raspberry Pi is effectively represented twice (once as 127.0.0.1, and again as 192.168.1.10) does not matter. If the Pi-hole container stops running, the Raspberry Pi will bypass 192.168.1.10 and fail over to 8.8.8.8, failing back to 127.0.0.1 when the Pi-hole container starts again. Install dig: $ sudo apt install dnsutils Test that Pi-hole is correctly configured (should respond 192.168.1.10): $ dig raspberrypi.home.arpa @192.168.1.10 To test on another machine if your network's DNS configuration is correct, and an ESP will resolve its DNS queries correctly, restart the other machine to ensure DNS changes are updated and then use: $ dig raspberrypi.home.arpa This should produce the same result as the previous command. If this fails to resolve the IP, check that the server in the response is 192.168.1.10 . If it's 127.0.0.xx check /etc/resolv.conf begins with nameserver 192.168.1.10 . If not, check the machine is configured to use DHCP and revisit Pi-hole as DNS . Microcontrollers \u00b6 If you want to avoid hardcoding your Raspberry Pi IP to your ESPhome devices, you need a DNS server that will do the resolving. This can be done using the Pi-hole container as described above. *.local won't work for ESPhome \u00b6 There is a special case for resolving *.local addresses. If you do a ping raspberrypi.local on your desktop Linux or the Raspberry Pi, it will first try using mDNS/bonjour to resolve the IP address raspberrypi.local. If this fails it will then ask the DNS server. ESPhome devices can't use mDNS to resolve an IP address. You need a proper DNS server to respond to queries made by an ESP. As such, dig raspberrypi.local will fail, simulating ESPhome device behavior. This is as intended, and you should use raspberrypi.home.arpa as the address on your ESP-device. Getting a clean slate \u00b6 If Pi-hole misbehaves, you can always try starting from a clean slate by erasing Pi-hole's persistent storage area. Erasing the persistent storage area causes PiHole to re-initialise its data structures on the next launch. You will lose: Any configuration options you may have set via the web GUI that are not otherwise reflected in environment variables . Any whitelist, blacklist or local DNS records you entered.

(advanced) reverse DNS query handling First, understand that there are two basic types of DNS query: forward queries : question: \"what is the IP address of fred.yourdomain.com?\" answer: 192.168.1.100 reverse queries : question: \"what is the domain name for 192.168.1.100?\" answer: fred.yourdomain.com Pi-hole has its own built-in DNS server which can answer both kinds of queries. The implementation is useful but doesn't offer all the features of a full-blown DNS server like BIND9. If you decide to implement a more capable DNS server to work alongside Pi-hole, you will need to understand the following Pi-hole environment variables: REV_SERVER= If you configure Pi-hole's built-in DNS server to be authoritative for your local domain name, REV_SERVER=false is appropriate, in which case none of the variables discussed below has any effect. Setting REV_SERVER=true allows Pi-hole to forward queries that it can't answer to a local upstream DNS server, typically running inside your network. REV_SERVER_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com (where \"yourdomain.com\" is an example) The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the domain of the local network router\". The words \"if conditional forwarding is enabled\" mean \"when REV_SERVER=true \". However, this option really has little-to-nothing to do with the \"domain of the local network router \". Your router may have an IP address that reverse-resolves to a local domain name (eg gateway.mydomain.com) but this is something most routers are unaware of, even if you have configured your router's DHCP server to inform clients that they should assume a default domain of \"yourdomain.com\". This variable actually tells Pi-hole the name of your local domain. In other words, it tells Pi-hole to consider the possibility that an unqualified name like \"fred\" could be the fully-qualified domain name \"fred.yourdomain.com\". REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.5 (where 192.168.1.5 is an example): The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the IP of the local network router\". This option tells Pi-hole where to direct forward queries that it can't answer. In other words, Pi-hole will send a forward query for fred.yourdomain.com to 192.168.1.5. It may be appropriate to set REV_SERVER_TARGET to the IP address of your router (eg 192.168.1.1) but, unless your router is running as a DNS server (not impossible but uncommon), the router will likely just relay any queries to your ISP's DNS servers (or other well-known DNS servers like 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 if you have configured those). Those external DNS servers are unlikely to be able to resolve queries for names in your private domain, and won't be able to do anything sensible with reverse queries if your home network uses RFC1918 addressing (which most do: 182.168.x.x being the most common example). Forwarding doesn't guarantee that 192.168.1.5 will be able to answer the query. The DNS server at 192.168.1.5 may well relay the query to yet another server. In other words, this environment variable does no more than set the next hop. If you are planning on using this option, the target needs to be a DNS server that is authoritative for your local domain and that, pretty much, is going to be a local upstream DNS server inside your home network like another Raspberry Pi running BIND9. REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.1.0/24 (where 192.168.1.0/24 is an example) The Pi-hole documentation says: \"If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the reverse DNS zone (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)\". This is correct but it lacks detail. The string \"192.168.1.0/24\" defines your local subnet using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Most home subnets use a subnet-mask of 255.255.255.0. If you write that out in binary, it is 24 1-bits followed by 8 0-bits, as in: 255 . 255 . 255 . 0 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 Those 24 one-bits are where the /24 comes from in 192.168.1.0/24 . When you perform a bitwise logical AND between that subnet mask and 192.168.1.0, the \".0\" is removed (conceptually), as in: 192.168.1.0 AND 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.1 What it means is: The network prefix is \"192.168.1\". This host on the 192.168.1 network is the reserved address \"192.168.1.0\". It is better to think of this as \"the network prefix followed by all-zero bits in the host portion\". It is not common to see the .0 address used in practice. A device either knows its IP address or it doesn't. If it doesn't then it won't know its prefix so it will use 0.0.0.0 as a substitute for \"this\". The range of IP addresses available for allocation to hosts on this subnet is 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254 inclusive. All hosts on the 192.168.1 network (ie broadcast) is the reserved address \"192.168.1.255\". It is better to think of this as \"the network prefix followed by all-one bits in the host portion\". When you set REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.1.0/24 you are telling Pi-hole that reverse queries for the host range 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254 should be sent to the REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.5 .","title":"Other variables"},{"location":"Containers/Pi-hole/#webGUI","text":"Note: in order for Web GUI settings to have any effects, you need to configure the RPi or other machines to use it.

Some chicken-and-egg situations can exist if, for example, the Pi-hole container is down when another process (eg apt or docker-compose ) needs to do something that depends on DNS services being available. Nevertheless, if you configure Pi-hole to be local DNS resolver, then you will probably want to configure your Raspberry Pi to use the Pi-hole container in the first instance, and then fall back to a public DNS server if the container is down. As a beginner, this is probably what you want regardless. Do this by running the commands: $ echo \"name_servers=127.0.0.1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ echo \"name_servers_append=8.8.8.8\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ echo \"resolv_conf_local_only=NO\" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ sudo resolvconf -u This results in a configuration that will continue working, even if the Pi-hole container isn't running. Detailed explanations of these commands name_servers=127.0.0.1 instructs the Raspberry Pi to direct DNS queries to the loopback address. Port 53 is implied. If the Pi-hole container is running in: non-host mode, Docker is listening to port 53 and forwards the queries to the Pi-hole container; host mode, the Pi-hole container is listening to port 53. name_servers_append=8.8.8.8 instructs the Raspberry Pi to fail-over to 8.8.8.8 if Pi-hole does not respond. You can replace 8.8.8.8 (a Google service) with: Another well-known public DNS server like 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare). The IP address(es) of your ISP's DNS hosts (generally available from your ISP's web site). The IP address of another DNS server running in your local network (eg BIND9). The IP address of your home router. Most home routers default to the ISP's DNS hosts but you can usually change your router's configuration to bypass your ISP in favour of public servers like 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. You need slightly different syntax if you want to add multiple fallback servers. For example, suppose your fallback hosts are a local server (eg 192.168.1.2) running BIND9 and 8.8.8.8. The command would be: $ echo 'name_servers_append=\"192.168.1.2 8.8.8.8\"' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf resolv_conf_local_only=NO is needed so that 127.0.0.1 and 8.8.8.8 can coexist. The resolvconf -u command instructs Raspberry Pi OS to rebuild the active resolver configuration. In principle, that means parsing /etc/resolvconf.conf to derive /etc/resolv.conf . This command can sometimes return the error \"Too few arguments\". You should ignore that error. flowchart LR RERECONF[\"/etc/resolvconf.conf\"] --- UP([resolvconf -u]) DHCP[DHCP provided DNS-server] --- UP UP -- \"generates\" --> RECONF[\"/etc/resolv.conf\"] classDef command fill:#9996,stroke-width:0px class UP command Advanced options: ignoring DHCP provided DNS-servers, local domain name search If you wish to prevent the Raspberry Pi from including the address(es) of DNS servers learned from DHCP, you can instruct the DHCP client running on the Raspberry Pi to ignore the information coming from the DHCP server: $ echo 'nooption domain_name_servers' | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcpcd.conf $ sudo service dhcpcd reload $ sudo resolvconf -u If you have followed the steps in Adding local domain names to define names for your local hosts, you can inform the Raspberry Pi of that fact like this: $ echo 'search_domains=home.arpa' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf.conf $ sudo resolvconf -u That will add the following line to /etc/resolv.conf : search home.arpa Then, when you refer to a host by a short name (eg \"fred\") the Raspberry Pi will also consider \"fred.home.arpa\" when trying to discover the IP address. Interaction with other containers Docker provides a special IP 127.0.0.11, which listens to DNS queries and resolves them according to the host RPi's resolv.conf. Containers usually rely on this to perform DNS lookups. This is nice as it won't present any surprises as DNS lookups on both the host and in the containers will yeild the same results.

This is usually referred to as a static binding and associates the Raspberry Pi's MAC address with a fixed IP address. Keep in mind that many Raspberry Pis have both Ethernet and WiFi interfaces. It is generally prudent to establish static bindings for both network interfaces in your DHCP server.

The Dockerfile used to customise Prometheus for IOTstack. A pre-launch script to handle container self-repair before launching the Prometheus service. Defaults for IOTstack, used to initialise on first run, and for container self-repair. The working service definition (only relevant to old-menu, copied from \u2776). The Compose file (includes \u2776). The persistent storage area . The configuration directory . How Prometheus gets built for IOTstack \u00b6 Prometheus source code ( GitHub ) \u00b6 The source code for Prometheus lives at GitHub prometheus/prometheus . Prometheus images ( DockerHub ) \u00b6 Periodically, the source code is recompiled and the resulting image is pushed to prom/prometheus on DockerHub . IOTstack menu \u00b6 When you select Prometheus in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run \u00b6 On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose Prometheus as one of your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the prometheus fragment, it finds: prometheus : container_name : prometheus build : ./.templates/prometheus/. The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/prometheus/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: FROM prom/prometheus:latest If you need to pin to a particular version of Prometheus , the Dockerfile is the place to do it. See Prometheus version pinning . The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add configuration defaults appropriate for IOTstack. Add docker-entrypoint.sh which: Ensures the internal directory /prometheus/config/ exists; Copies any configuration files that have gone missing into that directory. Enforces \"pi:pi\" ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/prometheus/data/config . Launches the Prometheus service. The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Prometheus has been built, you may see two rows for Prometheus : $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_prometheus latest 1815f63da5f0 23 minutes ago 169MB prom/prometheus latest 3f9575991a6c 3 days ago 169MB prom/prometheus is the base image ; and iotstack_prometheus is the local image . You may see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Whether you see one or two rows depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Dependencies: CAdvisor and Node Exporter \u00b6 The CAdvisor and Node Exporter are included in the Prometheus service definition as dependent containers. What that means is that each time you start Prometheus , docker-compose ensures that CAdvisor and Node Exporter are already running, and keeps them running. The default configuration for Prometheus assumes CAdvisor and Node Exporter are running and starts scraping information from those targets as soon as it launches. Configuring Prometheus \u00b6 Configuration directory \u00b6 The configuration directory for the IOTstack implementation of Prometheus is at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/prometheus/data/config That directory contains two files: config.yml ; and prometheus.yml . If you delete either file, Prometheus will replace it with a default the next time the container starts. This \"self-repair\" function is intended to provide reasonable assurance that Prometheus will at least start instead of going into a restart loop. Unless you decide to change it , the config folder and its contents are owned by \"pi:pi\". This means you can edit the files in the configuration directory without needing the sudo command. Ownership is enforced each time the container restarts. Active configuration file \u00b6 The file named config.yml is the active configuration. This is the file you should edit if you want to make changes. The default structure of the file is: global : scrape_interval : 10s evaluation_interval : 10s scrape_configs : - job_name : \"iotstack\" static_configs : - targets : - localhost:9090 - cadvisor:8080 - nodeexporter:9100 To cause a running instance of Prometheus to notice a change to this file: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart prometheus $ docker logs prometheus Note: The YAML parser used by Prometheus seems to be exceptionally sensitive to syntax errors (far less tolerant than docker-compose ). For this reason, you should always check the Prometheus log after any configuration change. Reference configuration file \u00b6 The file named prometheus.yml is a reference configuration. It is a copy of the original configuration file that ships inside the Prometheus container at the path: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml Editing prometheus.yml has no effect. It is provided as a convenience to help you follow examples on the web. If you want to make the contents of prometheus.yml the active configuration, you need to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/prometheus/data/config $ cp prometheus.yml config.yml $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart prometheus $ docker logs prometheus Environment variables \u00b6 The IOTstack implementation of Prometheus supports two environment variables: environment : - IOTSTACK_UID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?IOTSTACK_UID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - IOTSTACK_GID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?IOTSTACK_GID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} Those variables control ownership of the Configuration directory and its contents. Those environment variables are present in the standard IOTstack service definition for Prometheus and have the effect of assigning ownership to your current user, e.g. \"pi\". If you delete those environment variables from your Compose file, the Configuration directory will be owned by \"nobody:nobody\"; otherwise the directory and its contents will be owned by whatever values you pass for those variables. Migration considerations \u00b6 Under the original IOTstack implementation of Prometheus (just \"as it comes\" from DockerHub ), the service definition expected the configuration file to be at: ~/IOTstack/services/prometheus/config.yml Under this implementation of Prometheus , the configuration file has moved to: ~/IOTstack/volumes/prometheus/data/config/config.yml The change of location is one of the things that allows self-repair to work properly. Some of the assumptions behind the default configuration file have changed. In particular, instead of the entire scrape_configs block being commented-out, it is active and defines localhost , cadvisor and nodeexporter as targets. You should compare the old and new versions and decide which settings need to be migrated into the new configuration file. If you change the configuration file, restart Prometheus and then check the log for errors: $ docker-compose restart prometheus $ docker logs prometheus Note: The YAML parser used by Prometheus is very sensitive to syntax errors. Always check the Prometheus log after any configuration change. Upgrading Prometheus \u00b6 You can update cadvisor and nodeexporter like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull cadvisor nodeexporter $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This \"simple pull\" strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Prometheus is available is to check the prom/prometheus tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Prometheus like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull prometheus $ docker-compose up -d prometheus $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; prometheus is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Prometheus container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Whether an old base image exists depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Prometheus version pinning \u00b6 If you need to pin Prometheus to a particular version: Use your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/.templates/prometheus/Dockerfile Find the line: FROM prom/prometheus:latest Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to. For example, to pin to version 2.30.2: FROM prom/prometheus:2.30.2 Save the file and tell docker-compose to rebuild the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build prometheus $ docker system prune The new local image is built, then the new container is instantiated based on that image. The prune deletes the old local image . Note: As well as preventing Docker from updating the base image , pinning will also block incoming updates to the Dockerfile from a git pull . Nothing will change until you decide to remove the pin.","title":"Prometheus"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#prometheus","text":"","title":"Prometheus"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#references","text":"Prometheus home GitHub : Prometheus CAdvisor Node Exporter DockerHub : Prometheus CAdvisor Node Exporter","title":"References"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#overview","text":"Prometheus is a collection of three containers: Prometheus CAdvisor Node Exporter The default configuration for Prometheus supplied with IOTstack scrapes information from all three containers.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#installProm","text":"","title":"Installing Prometheus"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#installPromNewMenu","text":"When you select Prometheus in the IOTstack menu, you must also select: prometheus-cadvisor; and prometheus-nodeexporter .

Always check the Prometheus log after any configuration change.","title":"Migration considerations"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#upgradingPrometheus","text":"You can update cadvisor and nodeexporter like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull cadvisor nodeexporter $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This \"simple pull\" strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Prometheus is available is to check the prom/prometheus tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Prometheus like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull prometheus $ docker-compose up -d prometheus $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; prometheus is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Prometheus container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Whether an old base image exists depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images.","title":"Upgrading Prometheus"},{"location":"Containers/Prometheus/#versionPinning","text":"If you need to pin Prometheus to a particular version: Use your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/.templates/prometheus/Dockerfile Find the line: FROM prom/prometheus:latest Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to.

The prune deletes the old local image . Note: As well as preventing Docker from updating the base image , pinning will also block incoming updates to the Dockerfile from a git pull .

Make your edits directly to docker-compose.yml . Note Don't use user and group names because these variables are applied inside the container where those names are (probably) undefined. The only thing these variables affect is the ownership of ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app and its contents.

The output of the Dockerfile run is a new local image tagged with the name iotstack_python . The iotstack_python image is instantiated to become the running container.

The app.py Python script is run. when things go wrong - check the log \u00b6 If the container misbehaves, the log is your friend: $ docker logs python project development life-cycle \u00b6 It is critical that you understand that all of your project development should occur within the folder: ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app So long as you are performing some sort of routine backup (either with a supplied script or a third party solution like Paraphraser/IOTstackBackup ), your work will be protected. getting started \u00b6 Start by editing the file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app/app.py If you need other supporting scripts or data files, also add those to the directory: ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app Any time you change something in the app folder, tell the running python container to notice the change by: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart python reading and writing to disk \u00b6 Consider this line in the service definition: - ./volumes/python/app:/usr/src/app The leading period means \"the directory containing docker-compose.yml \" so it the same as: - ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app:/usr/src/app Then, you split the line at the \":\", resulting in: The external directory = ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app The internal directory = /usr/src/app What it means is that: Any file you put into the external directory (or any sub-directories you create within the external directory) will be visible to your Python script running inside the container at the same relative position in the internal directory. Any file or sub-directory created in the internal directory by your Python script running inside the container will be visible outside the container at the same relative position in the external directory. The contents of external directory and, therefore, the internal directory will persist across container launches. If your script writes into any other directory inside the container, the data will be lost when the container re-launches. getting a clean slate \u00b6 If you make a mess of things and need to start from a clean slate, erase the persistent storage area: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v python $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/python $ docker-compose up -d python The container will re-initialise the persistent storage area from its defaults. adding packages \u00b6 As you develop your project, you may find that you need to add supporting packages. For this example, we will assume you want to add \" Flask \" and \" beautifulsoup4 \". If you were developing a project outside of container-space, you would simply run: $ pip3 install -U Flask beautifulsoup4 You can do the same thing with the running container: $ docker exec python pip3 install -U Flask beautifulsoup4 and that will work \u2014 until the container is re-launched, at which point the added packages will disappear. To make Flask and beautifulsoup4 a permanent part of your container: Change your working directory: $ cd ~/IOTstack/services/python/app Use your favourite text editor to create the file requirements.txt in that directory. Each package you want to add should be on a line by itself: Flask beautifulsoup4 Tell Docker to rebuild the local Python image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --force-rm python $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate python $ docker system prune -f Note: You will see a warning about running pip as root - ignore it. Confirm that the packages have been added: $ docker exec python pip3 freeze | grep -e \"Flask\" -e \"beautifulsoup4\" beautifulsoup4==4.10.0 Flask==2.0.1 Continue your development work by returning to getting started . Note: The first time you following the process described above to create requirements.txt , a copy will appear at: ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app/requirements.txt This copy is the result of the \"self-repair\" code that runs each time the container starts noticing that requirements.txt is missing and making a copy from the defaults stored inside the image. If you make more changes to the master version of requirements.txt in the services directory and rebuild the local image, the copy in the volumes directory will not be kept in-sync. That's because the \"self-repair\" code never overwrites existing files. If you want to bring the copy of requirements.txt in the volumes directory up-to-date: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ rm ./volumes/python/app/requirements.txt $ docker-compose restart python The requirements.txt file will be recreated and it will be a copy of the version in the services directory as of the last image rebuild. making your own Python script the default \u00b6 Suppose the Python script you have been developing reaches a major milestone and you decide to \"freeze dry\" your work up to that point so that it becomes the default when you ask for a clean slate . Proceed like this: If you have added any packages by following the steps in adding packages , run the following command: $ docker exec python bash -c 'pip3 freeze >requirements.txt' That generates a requirements.txt representing the state of play inside the running container. Because it is running inside the container, the requirements.txt created by that command appears outside the container at: ~/IOTstack/volumes/python/app/requirements.txt Make your work the default: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ cp -r ./volumes/python/app/* ./services/python/app The cp command copies: your Python script; the optional requirements.txt (from step 1); and any other files you may have put into the Python working directory. Key point: everything copied into ./services/python/app will become part of the new local image. Terminate the Python container and erase its persistent storage area: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v python $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/python Note: If erasing the persistent storage area feels too risky, just move it out of the way: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes $ sudo mv python python.off Rebuild the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --force-rm python $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate python On its first launch, the new container will re-populate the persistent storage area but, this time, it will be your Python script and any other supporting files, rather than the original \"hello world\" script. Clean up by removing the old local image: $ docker system prune -f canning your project \u00b6 Suppose your project has reached the stage where you wish to put it into production as a service under its own name. Make two further assumptions: You have gone through the steps in making your own Python script the default and you are certain that the content of ./services/python/app correctly captures your project. You want to give your project the name \"wishbone\". Proceed like this: Stop the development project: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v python Remove the existing local image: $ docker rmi iotstack_python Rename the python services directory to the name of your project: $ cd ~/IOTstack/services $ mv python wishbone Edit the python service definition in docker-compose.yml and replace references to python with the name of your project. In the following, the original is on the left, the edited version on the right, and the lines that need to change are indicated with a \"|\": python : | wishbone : container_name : python | container_name : wishbone build : ./services/python/. | build : ./services/wishbone/. restart : unless-stopped restart : unless-stopped environment : environment : - TZ=Etc/UTC - TZ=Etc/UTC - IOTSTACK_UID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?...} - IOTSTACK_UID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?...} - IOTSTACK_GID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?...} - IOTSTACK_GID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?...} # ports: # ports: # - \"external:internal\" # - \"external:internal\" volumes : volumes : - ./volumes/python/app:/usr/src/app | - ./volumes/wishbone/app:/usr/src/app Note: if you make a copy of the python service definition and then perform the required \"wishbone\" edits on the copy, the python definition will still be active so docker-compose may try to bring up both services. You will eliminate the risk of confusing yourself if you follow these instructions \"as written\" by not leaving the python service definition in place. Start the renamed service: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d wishbone Remember: After you have done this, the persistent storage area will be at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/wishbone/app routine maintenance \u00b6 To make sure you are running from the most-recent base image of Python from Dockerhub: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull python $ docker-compose up -d python $ docker system prune -f $ docker system prune -f In words: Be in the right directory.

How Telegraf gets built for IOTstack \u00b6 IOTstack menu \u00b6 When you select Telegraf in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run \u00b6 On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d See also the Migration considerations (below). docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the telegraf fragment, it finds: telegraf : container_name : telegraf build : ./.templates/telegraf/. \u2026 The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/telegraf/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: FROM telegraf:latest If you need to pin to a particular version of Telegraf, the Dockerfile is the place to do it. See Telegraf version pinning . The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add the rsync package. This helps the container perform self-repair. Copy the default configuration file that comes with the DockerHub image (so it will be available as a fully-commented reference for the user) and make it read-only. Make a working version of the default configuration file from which comment lines and blank lines have been removed. Patch the working version to support communications with InfluxDB running in another container in the same IOTstack instance. Replace entrypoint.sh with a version which: calls rsync to perform self-repair if telegraf.conf goes missing; and enforces root:root ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf . The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Telegraf has been built, you may see two rows for Telegraf: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_telegraf latest 59861b7fe9ed 2 hours ago 292MB telegraf latest a721ac170fad 3 days ago 273MB telegraf is the base image ; and iotstack_telegraf is the local image . You may see the same pattern in Portainer , which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Whether you see one or two rows depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Migration considerations \u00b6 Under the original IOTstack implementation of Telegraf (just \"as it comes\" from DockerHub ), the service definition expected telegraf.conf to be at: ~/IOTstack/services/telegraf/telegraf.conf Under this implementation of Telegraf, the configuration file has moved to: ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf/telegraf.conf The change of location is one of the things that allows self-repair to work properly. With one exception, all prior and current versions of the default configuration file are identical in terms of their semantics. In other words, once you strip away comments and blank lines, and remove any \"active\" configuration options that simply repeat their default setting, you get the same subset of \"active\" configuration options. The default configuration file supplied with gcgarner/IOTstack is available here if you wish to refer to it. The exception is [[inputs.mqtt_consumer]] which is now provided as an optional addition. If your existing Telegraf configuration depends on that input, you will need to apply it. See applying optional additions . Logging \u00b6 You can inspect Telegraf's log by: $ docker logs telegraf These logs are ephemeral and will disappear when your Telegraf container is rebuilt. log message: database \"telegraf\" creation failed \u00b6 The following log message can be misleading: W! [outputs.influxdb] When writing to [http://influxdb:8086]: database \"telegraf\" creation failed: Post \"http://influxdb:8086/query\": dial tcp 172.30.0.9:8086: connect: connection refused If InfluxDB is not running when Telegraf starts, the depends_on: clause in Telegraf's service definition tells Docker to start InfluxDB (and Mosquitto) before starting Telegraf. Although it can launch the InfluxDB container first, Docker has no way of knowing when the influxd process running inside the InfluxDB container will start listening to port 8086. What this error message usually means is that Telegraf has tried to communicate with InfluxDB before the latter is ready to accept connections. Telegraf typically retries after a short delay and is then able to communicate with InfluxDB. Changing Telegraf's configuration \u00b6 The first time you launch the Telegraf container, the following structure will be created in the persistent storage area: ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf \u251c\u2500\u2500 [drwxr-xr-x root ] additions \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 [-rw-r--r-- root ] inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf \u251c\u2500\u2500 [-rw-r--r-- root ] telegraf.conf \u2514\u2500\u2500 [-r--r--r-- root ] telegraf-reference.conf The file: telegraf-reference.conf : is a reference copy of the default configuration file that ships with the base image for Telegraf when it is downloaded from DockerHub. It is nearly 9000 lines long and is mostly comments. is not used by Telegraf but will be replaced if you delete it. is marked \"read-only\" (even for root) as a reminder that it is only for your reference. Any changes you make will be ignored. telegraf.conf : is created by removing all comment lines and blank lines from telegraf-reference.conf , leaving only the \"active\" configuration options, and then adding options necessary for IOTstack. is less than 30 lines and is significantly easier to understand than telegraf-reference.conf . inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf \u2013 see Applying optional additions below. The intention of this structure is that you: search telegraf-reference.conf to find the configuration option you need; read the comments to understand what the option does and how to use it; and then import the option into the correct section of telegraf.conf . When you make a change to telegraf.conf , you activate it by restarting the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart telegraf Automatic includes to telegraf.conf \u00b6 inputs.docker.conf instructs Telegraf to collect metrics from Docker. Requires kernel control groups to be enabled to collect memory usage data. If not done during initial installation, enable by running (reboot required): $ echo $( cat /boot/cmdline.txt ) cgroup_memory = 1 cgroup_enable = memory | sudo tee /boot/cmdline.txt inputs.cpu_temp.conf collects cpu temperature. Applying optional additions \u00b6 The additions folder (see Significant directories and files ) is a mechanism for additional IOTstack-ready configuration options to be provided for Telegraf. Currently there is one addition: inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf which formed part of the gcgarner/IOTstack telegraf configuration and instructs Telegraf to subscribe to a metric feed from the Mosquitto broker. This assumes, of course, that something is publishing those metrics. Using inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf as the example, applying that addition to your Telegraf configuration file involves: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf $ grep -v \"^#\" additions/inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf | sudo tee -a telegraf.conf >/dev/null $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart telegraf The grep strips comment lines and the sudo tee is a safe way of appending the result to telegraf.conf . The restart causes Telegraf to notice the change. This result in the Telegraf service depending on the Mosquitto service, as such you may want to edit docker-compose.yml and add - mosquitto to the depends_on: of the telegraf service. Getting a clean slate \u00b6 Erasing the persistent storage area \u00b6 Erasing Telegraf's persistent storage area triggers self-healing and restores known defaults: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v telegraf $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/telegraf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf Note: You can also remove individual files within the persistent storage area and then trigger self-healing. For example, if you decide to edit telegraf-reference.conf and make a mess, you can restore the original version like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo rm ./volumes/telegraf/telegraf-reference.conf $ docker-compose restart telegraf Resetting the InfluxDB database \u00b6 To reset the InfluxDB database that Telegraf writes into, proceed like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v telegraf $ docker exec -it influxdb influx -precision = rfc3339 > drop database telegraf > exit $ docker-compose up -d telegraf In words: Be in the right directory. Stop the Telegraf container (while leaving the InfluxDB container running). Launch the Influx CLI inside the InfluxDB container. Delete the telegraf database, and then exit the CLI. Start the Telegraf container. This re-creates the database automatically. Upgrading Telegraf \u00b6 You can update most containers like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Telegraf is available is to check the Telegraf tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Telegraf like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull telegraf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; telegraf is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Telegraf container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Whether an old base image exists depends on the version of docker-compose you are using and how your version of docker-compose builds local images. Telegraf version pinning \u00b6 If you need to pin Telegraf to a particular version: Use your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/.templates/telegraf/Dockerfile Find the line: FROM telegraf:latest Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to. For example, to pin to version 1.19.3: FROM telegraf:1.19.3 Save the file and tell docker-compose to rebuild the local image : $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build telegraf $ docker system prune The new local image is built, then the new container is instantiated based on that image. The prune deletes the old local image . Note: As well as preventing Docker from updating the base image , pinning will also block incoming updates to the Dockerfile from a git pull . Nothing will change until you decide to remove the pin.","title":"Telegraf"},{"location":"Containers/Telegraf/#telegraf","text":"This document discusses an IOTstack-specific version of Telegraf built on top of influxdata/influxdata-docker/telegraf using a Dockerfile .

Using inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf as the example, applying that addition to your Telegraf configuration file involves: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf $ grep -v \"^#\" additions/inputs.mqtt_consumer.conf | sudo tee -a telegraf.conf >/dev/null $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart telegraf The grep strips comment lines and the sudo tee is a safe way of appending the result to telegraf.conf . The restart causes Telegraf to notice the change. This result in the Telegraf service depending on the Mosquitto service, as such you may want to edit docker-compose.yml and add - mosquitto to the depends_on: of the telegraf service.","title":"Applying optional additions"},{"location":"Containers/Telegraf/#cleanSlate","text":"","title":"Getting a clean slate"},{"location":"Containers/Telegraf/#resetDB","text":"Erasing Telegraf's persistent storage area triggers self-healing and restores known defaults: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v telegraf $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/telegraf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf Note: You can also remove individual files within the persistent storage area and then trigger self-healing.

This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Telegraf is available is to check the Telegraf tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Telegraf like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull telegraf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; telegraf is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Telegraf container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image .

It can securely connect you to your home network, allowing you to access your home network's local services from anywhere. It can also secure your traffic when using public internet connections. Reference: WireGuard home page Assumptions: These instructions assume that you have privileges to configure your network's gateway (router). If you are not able to make changes to your network's firewall settings, then you will not be able to finish this setup. In common with most VPN technologies, WireGuard assumes that the WAN side of your network's gateway has a public IP address which is reachable directly. WireGuard may not work if that assumption does not hold. If you strike this problem, you have to take it up with your ISP. Installing WireGuard under IOTstack \u00b6 You increase your chances of a trouble-free installation by performing the installation steps in the following order. Step 1: Update your Raspberry Pi OS \u00b6 To be able to run WireGuard successfully, your Raspberry Pi needs to be fully up-to-date. If you want to understand why, see the read only flag . $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y Step 2: Set up a Dynamic DNS name \u00b6 Before you can use WireGuard (or any VPN solution), you need a mechanism for your remote clients to reach your home router. You have two choices: Obtain a permanent IP address for your home router from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Approach your ISP if you wish to pursue this option. It generally involves additional charges. Use a Dynamic DNS service. See IOTstack documentation Accessing your device from the internet . The rest of this documentation assumes you have chosen this option. Step 3: Understand the Service Definition \u00b6 This is the service definition template that IOTstack uses for WireGuard: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 wireguard : container_name : wireguard image : ghcr.io/linuxserver/wireguard restart : unless-stopped environment : - PUID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?IOTSTACK_UID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - PGID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?IOTSTACK_GID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - TZ=Etc/UTC - SERVERURL=your.dynamic.dns.name - SERVERPORT=51820 - PEERS=laptop,phone,tablet - PEERDNS=auto # - PEERDNS=172.30.0.1 - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 ports : - \"51820:51820/udp\" volumes : - ./volumes/wireguard:/config - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro cap_add : - NET_ADMIN - SYS_MODULE sysctls : - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 Unfortunately, that service definition will not work \"as is\". It needs to be configured. Key points: Everything in the environment: section from SERVERURL= down to PEERDNS= (inclusive) affects WireGuard's generated configurations (the QR codes). In other words, any time you change any of those values, any existing QR codes will stop working. Step 4: Decide what to configure \u00b6 With most containers, you can continue to tweak environment variables and settings without upsetting the container's basic behaviour. WireGuard is a little different. You really need to think, carefully, about how you want to configure the service before you start. If you change your mind later, you generally have to start from a clean slate . Fields that you should always configure \u00b6 TZ= should be set to your local timezone. Example: - TZ=Australia/Sydney Note: Never use quote marks around the right hand side of a time-zone definition. SERVERURL= should be set to the domain name you have registered with a Dynamic DNS service provider. Example: - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org PEERS= should be a comma-separated list of your client devices (all the phones, tablets, laptops, desktops you want to use remotely to get back into your home network). Example: - PEERS=jill-macbook,jack-chromebook,alex-nokia-g10 Note: Many examples on the web use \"PEERS=n\" where \"n\" is a number. In practice, that approach seems to be a little fragile and is not recommended for IOTstack. Optional configuration - DNS resolution for peers \u00b6 You have several options for how your remote peers resolve DNS requests: PEERDNS=auto DNS queries made on connected WireGuard clients should work as if they were made on the host. If you configure your ad-blocker into the host's resolveconf.conf , Wireguard clients will also automatically use it. Details: The default value of auto instructs the WireGuard service running within the WireGuard container to use a DNS-service, coredns, also running in the Wireguard container. Coredns by default directs queries to 127.0.0.11, which Docker intercepts and forwards to whichever resolvers are specified in the Raspberry Pi's /etc/resolv.conf . PEERDNS=auto with custom-cont-init This configuration instructs WireGuard to forward DNS queries from remote peers to any host daemon or container which is listening on port 53. This is the option you will want to choose if you are running an ad-blocking DNS server (eg PiHole or AdGuardHome ) in a container on the same host as WireGuard, and you want your remote clients to obtain DNS resolution via the ad-blocker, but don't want your Raspberry Pi host to use it. Acknowledgement: thanks to @ukkopahis for developing this option. To activate this feature: Make sure your WireGuard service definition contains PEERDNS=auto . Start the WireGuard container by executing: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d wireguard This ensures that the ~/IOTstack/volumes/wireguard folder structure is created and remote client configurations are (re)generated properly. Run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo cp ./.templates/wireguard/use-container-dns.sh ./volumes/wireguard/custom-cont-init.d/ $ docker-compose restart wireguard The presence of use-container-dns.sh causes WireGuard to redirect incoming DNS queries to the default gateway on the internal bridged network. That, in turn, results in the queries being forwarded to any other container that is listening for DNS traffic on port 53. It does not matter if that other container is PiHole, AdGuardHome, bind9 or any other kind of DNS server. Do note, however, that this configuration creates a dependency between WireGuard and the container providing DNS resolution. You may wish to make that explicit in your docker-compose.yml by adding these lines to your WireGuard service definition: depends_on : - pihole Substitute adguardhome or bind9 for pihole , as appropriate. Once activated, this feature will remain active until you decide to deactivate it. If you ever wish to deactivate it, run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo rm ./volumes/wireguard/custom-cont-init.d/use-container-dns.sh $ docker-compose restart wireguard PEERDNS=\u00abip address\u00bb A third possibility is if you have a local upstream DNS server. You can specify the IP address of that server so that remote peers receive DNS resolution from that host. For example: - PEERDNS=192.168.203.65 Do note that changes to PEERDNS will not be updated to existing clients, and as such you may want to use PEERDNS=auto unless you have a very specific requirement. Optional configuration - WireGuard ports \u00b6 The WireGuard service definition template follows the convention of using UDP port \"51820\" in three places. You can leave it like that and it will just work. There is no reason to change the defaults unless you want to. To understand what each port number does, it is better to think of them like this: environment: - SERVERPORT=\u00abpublic\u00bb ports: - \"\u00abexternal\u00bb:\u00abinternal\u00bb/udp\" These definitions are going to be used throughout this documentation: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port is the port number that your remote WireGuard clients (phone, laptop etc) will try to reach. This is the port number that your router needs to expose to the outside world. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is the port number that Docker, running on your Raspberry Pi, will be listening on. Your router needs to forward WireGuard incoming traffic to the \u00abexternal\u00bb port on your Raspberry Pi. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is the port number that WireGuard (the server process) will be listening on inside the WireGuard container. Docker handles forwarding between the \u00abexternal\u00bb and \u00abinternal\u00bb port. Rule #1: You can change the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports but you can't change the \u00abinternal\u00bb port unless you are prepared to do a lot more work. Rule #2: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port forms part of the QR codes. If you decide to change the \u00abpublic\u00bb port after you generate the QR codes, you will have to start over from a clean slate . Rule #3: Your router needs to know about both the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports so, if you decide to change either of those, you must also reconfigure your router. See Understanding WireGuard's port numbers if you want more information on how the various port numbers are used. Step 5: Configure WireGuard \u00b6 There are two approaches: Let the menu generate a docker-compose.yml with the default WireGuard service definition template, and then edit docker-compose.yml . Prepare a compose-override.yml file, then run the menu and have it perform the substitutions for you. Of the two, the first is generally the simpler and means you don't have to re-run the menu whenever you want to change WireGuard's configuration. Method 1: Configure WireGuard by editing docker-compose.yml \u00b6 Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose the \"Build Stack\" option. If WireGuard is not already selected, select it. Press enter to begin the build. Choose Exit. Open docker-compose.yml in your favourite text editor. Navigate to the WireGuard service definition. Implement the decisions you took in decide what to configure . Save your work. Method 2: Configure WireGuard using compose-override.yml \u00b6 The Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack page describes how to use an override file to allow the menu to incorporate your custom configurations into the final docker-compose.yml file. You will need to create the compose-override.yml before running the menu to build your stack. If you have already built your stack, you'll have to rebuild it after creating compose-override.yml . Use your favourite text editor to create (or open) the override file. The file is expected to be at the path: ~/IOTstack/compose-override.yml Define overrides to implement the decisions you took in Decide what to configure . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 services : wireguard : environment : - PUID=${IOTSTACK_UID:?IOTSTACK_UID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - PGID=${IOTSTACK_GID:?IOTSTACK_GID must be defined in ~/IOTstack/.env} - TZ=Australia/Sydney - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org - SERVERPORT=51820 - PEERS=laptop,phone,tablet - PEERDNS=auto - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 Key points: The override file works at the section level. Therefore, you have to include all of the environment variables from the template, not just the ones you want to alter. If your override file contains configurations for other containers, make sure the file only has a single services: directive at the start. Save your work. Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose the \"Build Stack\" option. If WireGuard is not already selected, select it. Press enter to begin the build. Choose Exit. Check your work by running: $ cat docker-compose.yml and verify that the wireguard service definition is as you expect. Step 6: Start WireGuard \u00b6 To start WireGuard, bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Confirm that WireGuard has started properly by running: $ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.RunningFor}}\\t{{.Status}}\" --filter name = wireguard Repeat the command a few times with a short delay in between. You are looking for signs that the WireGuard container is restarting. If the container seems to be restarting then this command is your friend: $ docker logs wireguard See also discussion of the read-only flag . Confirm that WireGuard has generated the expected configurations. For example, given the following setting in docker-compose.yml : - PEERS=jill-macbook,jack-chromebook,alex-nokia-g10 you would expect a result something like this: $ tree ./volumes/wireguard volumes/wireguard/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 coredns \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Corefile \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom-cont-init.d \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom-services.d \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_jack-chromebook \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_jack-chromebook \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_jill-macbook \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_jill-macbook \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u251c\u2500\u2500 server \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-server \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-server \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer.conf \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.conf \u2514\u2500\u2500 wg0.conf Notice how each element in the PEERS= list is represented by a sub-directory prefixed with peer_ . You should expect the same pattern for your peers. Step 7: Save your WireGuard client configuration files (QR codes) \u00b6 The first time you launch WireGuard, it generates cryptographically protected configurations for your remote clients and encapsulates those configurations in QR codes. You can see the QR codes by running: $ docker logs wireguard WireGuard's log is ephemeral, which means it resets each time the container is re-created. In other words, you can't rely on going back to the log to obtain your QR codes if you lose them. WireGuard also records the QR codes as .png files. In fact, the QR codes shown by docker logs wireguard are just side-effects of the .png files as they are created. If your Raspberry Pi has a GUI (such as a screen attached to an HDMI port or a VNC connection), you can always retrieve the QR codes by opening the .png files in the GUI. If, however, your Raspberry Pi is running headless, you will need to copy the .png files to a system that is capable of displaying them, such as a Mac or PC. You can use SCP to do that. See ssh tutorial if you need help setting up SSH (of which SCP is a part). For example, to copy all PNG files from your Raspberry Pi to a target system: $ find ~/IOTstack/volumes/wireguard -name \"*.png\" -exec scp {} user@hostorip:. \\; Note: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the GUI-capable target computer; and user is a valid username on the target computer. If you want to work in the other direction (ie from the GUI-capable system), you can try: $ scp pi@hostorip:IOTstack/volumes/wireguard/peer_jill-macbook/peer_jill-macbook.png . In this case: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the Raspberry Pi that is running WireGuard. Keep in mind that each QR code contains everything needed for any device to access your home network via WireGuard. Treat your .png files as \"sensitive documents\". Step 8: Configure your router with a NAT rule \u00b6 A typical home network will have a firewall that effectively blocks all incoming attempts from the Internet to open a new connection with a device on your network. To use a VPN from outside of your home network (which is precisely the point of running the service!), you need to configure your router to allow incoming WireGuard traffic to reach the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. These instructions assume you have the privileges to do that. If you have not used your router's administrative interface before, the default login credentials may be physically printed on the device or in its instruction manual. If you have never changed the default login credentials, you should take the time to do that. Routers have wildly different user interfaces but the concepts will be the same. This section describes the basic technique but if you are unsure how to do this on your particular router model, the best idea would be to search the web for: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] port forwarding configuration\"; or \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] NAT configuration\" A typical configuration process goes something like this: The router sub-process you need to configure is called Network Address Translation (NAT) but it's not unheard of for this functionality to be grouped with FireWall. The NAT component you are looking for probably has a name like \"Port Redirection\", \"Port Forwarding\", \"NAT Forwarding\" or \"NAT Virtual Server\". It might also be under \"Open Ports\" but those are usually one-to-one mappings (ie incomingPort=outgoingPort), apply to port ranges, and are intended to target a single DMZ host. The configuration screen will contain at least the following fields: Field Value Interface router's WAN interface Private IP x.x.x.x Private Port \u00abexternal\u00bb Protocol UDP Public Port \u00abpublic\u00bb Service Name WireGuard The fields in the above list are in alphabetical order. They will almost certainly be in a different order in your router and may also have different names: Interface is typically a popup menu. Generally it will either default to the name of the physical port on your router that connects to the outside world, or be some other sensible default like \"All\". Private IP (or Internal IP ) is the IP address of the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. Note that this pretty much forces you to give your Raspberry Pi a statically-configured IP address (either a static binding in your DHCP server or a hard-coded address in the Raspberry Pi itself). Private Port (or Internal Port ) needs to be the value you chose for \u00abexternal\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Yes, this does sound counterintuitive but it's a matter of perspective. From the router's perspective, the port is on the private or internal part of your home network. From Docker's perspective, the port is \u00abexternal\u00bb to container-space. Protocol will usually default to \"TCP\" but you must change it to \"UDP\". Public Port or External Port needs to be the value you chose for \u00abpublic\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Service Name (or Service Type ) is typically a text field, an editable menu (where you can either make a choice or type your own value), or a button approximating an editable menu. If you are given the option of choosing \"WireGuard\", do that, otherwise just type that name into the field. It has no significance other than reminding you what the rule is for. Step 9: Configure your remote WireGuard clients \u00b6 This is a massive topic and one which is well beyond the scope of this guide. You really will have to work it out for yourself. Start by Googling: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] install WireGuard client\". You will find the list of client software at WireGuard Installation . For portable devices (eg iOS and Android) it usually boils down to: Install the app on your portable device. Display the QR code the WireGuard server generated for the device. Launch the app. Point the device's camera at the QR code. Follow your nose. Understanding WireGuard's port numbers \u00b6 Here's a concrete example configuration using three different port numbers: environment: - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org - SERVERPORT=51620 ports: - \"51720:51820/udp\" In other words: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port is 51620. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is 51720. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is 51820. You also need to make a few assumptions: The host running the remote WireGuard client (eg a mobile phone with the WireGuard app installed) has been allocated the IP address 55.66.77.88 when it connected to the Internet over 3G/4G/5G. When the remote WireGuard client initiated the session, it chose UDP port 44524 as its source port. The actual number chosen is (essentially) random and only significant to the client. Your Internet Service Provider allocated the IP address 12.13.14.15 to the WAN side of your router. You have done all the steps in Set up a Dynamic DNS name and your WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) is being propagated to your Dynamic DNS service provider. Here's a reference model to help explain what occurs: The remote WireGuard client: Obtains the Dynamic DNS domain name (\"downunda.duckdns.org\") and \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) from the configuration contained within the QR code. Recall that those values are obtained from the SERVERURL= and SERVERPORT= environment variables in docker-compose.yml . Executes a DNS query for the domain name \"downunda.duckdns.org\" to obtains the WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) of your home router. Addresses outgoing packets to 12.13.14.15:51620. You configure a NAT port-forwarding rule in your router which accepts incoming traffic on the \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) and uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the Raspberry Pi and destination port to the \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port (51720). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 192.168.203.60:51720. Docker is listening to the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port 51720. Docker uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the WireGuard container and destination port to the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 172.18.0.6:51820. The packet is then routed to the internal bridged network, and delivered to the WireGuard server process running in the container which is listening on the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). A reciprocal process occurs when the WireGuard server process sends packets back to the remote WireGuard client. The following table summarises the transformations as the client and server exchange information: Even if you use port 51820 everywhere (the default), all this Network Address Translation still occurs. Keep this in mind if you are trying to debug WireGuard because you may actually find it simpler to understand what is going on if you use different numbers for the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports. This model is a slight simplification because the remote client may also be also operating behind a router performing Network Address Translation. It is just easier to understand the basic concepts if you assume the remote client has a publicly-routable IP address. Debugging techniques \u00b6 Monitor WireGuard traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi \u00b6 If tcpdump is not installed on your Raspberry Pi, you can install it by: $ sudo apt install tcpdump After that, you can capture traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi by: $ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n udp port \u00abexternal\u00bb Press ctrl c to terminate the capture. Monitor WireGuard traffic between your Raspberry Pi and the WireGuard container \u00b6 First, you need to add tcpdump to the container. You only need to do this once per debugging session. The package will remain in place until the next time you re-create the container. $ docker exec wireguard bash -c 'apt update ; apt install -y tcpdump' To monitor traffic: $ docker exec -t wireguard tcpdump -i eth0 -n udp port \u00abinternal\u00bb Press ctrl c to terminate the capture. Is Docker listening on the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb port? \u00b6 $ PORT = \u00abexternal\u00bb ; sudo nmap -sU -p $PORT 127 .0.0.1 | grep \" $PORT /udp\" There will be a short delay. The expected answer is either: \u00abexternal\u00bb/udp open|filtered unknown = Docker is listening \u00abexternal\u00bb/udp closed unknown = Docker is not listening Success implies that the container is also listening.

This stops malicious users from working out which ports might be open. This test will not be useful if your router behaves like that. You will have to rely on tcpdump telling you whether your router is forwarding traffic to your Raspberry Pi. The read-only flag \u00b6 The :ro at the end of the following line in WireGuard's service definition means \"read only\": - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro If that flag is omitted then WireGuard may try to update the /lib/modules path in your operating system. To be clear, /lib/modules is both outside the WireGuard container and outside the normal persistent storage area in the ./volumes directory. The basic idea of containers is that processes are contained , include all their own dependencies, can be added and removed cleanly, and don't change the underlying operating system. Writing into /lib/modules is not needed on a Raspberry Pi, providing that Raspberry Pi OS is up-to-date. That is why the first step in the installation procedure tells you to bring the system up-to-date. If WireGuard refuses to install and you have good reason to suspect that WireGuard may be trying to write to /lib/modules then you can consider removing the :ro flag and re-trying. Just be aware that WireGuard will likely be modifying your operating system. Updating WireGuard \u00b6 To update the WireGuard container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull wireguard If a new image comes down, then: $ docker-compose up -d wireguard $ docker system prune Getting a clean slate \u00b6 If WireGuard misbehaves, you can start over from a clean slate. You may also need to do this if you change any of the following environment variables: - SERVERURL= - SERVERPORT= - PEERS= - PEERDNS= The procedure is: If WireGuard is running, terminate it: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v wireguard Erase the persistent storage area (essential): $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/wireguard Be very careful with that command and double-check your work before you hit return . Erasing the persistent storage area: destroys the old client configurations and invalidates any copies of QR codes.

If you configure your ad-blocker into the host's resolveconf.conf , Wireguard clients will also automatically use it. Details: The default value of auto instructs the WireGuard service running within the WireGuard container to use a DNS-service, coredns, also running in the Wireguard container. Coredns by default directs queries to 127.0.0.11, which Docker intercepts and forwards to whichever resolvers are specified in the Raspberry Pi's /etc/resolv.conf . PEERDNS=auto with custom-cont-init This configuration instructs WireGuard to forward DNS queries from remote peers to any host daemon or container which is listening on port 53. This is the option you will want to choose if you are running an ad-blocking DNS server (eg PiHole or AdGuardHome ) in a container on the same host as WireGuard, and you want your remote clients to obtain DNS resolution via the ad-blocker, but don't want your Raspberry Pi host to use it. Acknowledgement: thanks to @ukkopahis for developing this option. To activate this feature: Make sure your WireGuard service definition contains PEERDNS=auto . Start the WireGuard container by executing: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d wireguard This ensures that the ~/IOTstack/volumes/wireguard folder structure is created and remote client configurations are (re)generated properly. Run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo cp ./.templates/wireguard/use-container-dns.sh ./volumes/wireguard/custom-cont-init.d/ $ docker-compose restart wireguard The presence of use-container-dns.sh causes WireGuard to redirect incoming DNS queries to the default gateway on the internal bridged network. That, in turn, results in the queries being forwarded to any other container that is listening for DNS traffic on port 53. It does not matter if that other container is PiHole, AdGuardHome, bind9 or any other kind of DNS server. Do note, however, that this configuration creates a dependency between WireGuard and the container providing DNS resolution. You may wish to make that explicit in your docker-compose.yml by adding these lines to your WireGuard service definition: depends_on : - pihole Substitute adguardhome or bind9 for pihole , as appropriate. Once activated, this feature will remain active until you decide to deactivate it. If you ever wish to deactivate it, run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo rm ./volumes/wireguard/custom-cont-init.d/use-container-dns.sh $ docker-compose restart wireguard PEERDNS=\u00abip address\u00bb A third possibility is if you have a local upstream DNS server. You can specify the IP address of that server so that remote peers receive DNS resolution from that host. For example: - PEERDNS=192.168.203.65 Do note that changes to PEERDNS will not be updated to existing clients, and as such you may want to use PEERDNS=auto unless you have a very specific requirement.","title":"Optional configuration - DNS resolution for peers"},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#configurePorts","text":"The WireGuard service definition template follows the convention of using UDP port \"51820\" in three places. You can leave it like that and it will just work. There is no reason to change the defaults unless you want to.

This is the port number that your router needs to expose to the outside world. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is the port number that Docker, running on your Raspberry Pi, will be listening on. Your router needs to forward WireGuard incoming traffic to the \u00abexternal\u00bb port on your Raspberry Pi. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is the port number that WireGuard (the server process) will be listening on inside the WireGuard container. Docker handles forwarding between the \u00abexternal\u00bb and \u00abinternal\u00bb port.

You can see the QR codes by running: $ docker logs wireguard WireGuard's log is ephemeral, which means it resets each time the container is re-created. In other words, you can't rely on going back to the log to obtain your QR codes if you lose them. WireGuard also records the QR codes as .png files. In fact, the QR codes shown by docker logs wireguard are just side-effects of the .png files as they are created. If your Raspberry Pi has a GUI (such as a screen attached to an HDMI port or a VNC connection), you can always retrieve the QR codes by opening the .png files in the GUI. If, however, your Raspberry Pi is running headless, you will need to copy the .png files to a system that is capable of displaying them, such as a Mac or PC. You can use SCP to do that. See ssh tutorial if you need help setting up SSH (of which SCP is a part). For example, to copy all PNG files from your Raspberry Pi to a target system: $ find ~/IOTstack/volumes/wireguard -name \"*.png\" -exec scp {} user@hostorip:. \\; Note: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the GUI-capable target computer; and user is a valid username on the target computer. If you want to work in the other direction (ie from the GUI-capable system), you can try: $ scp pi@hostorip:IOTstack/volumes/wireguard/peer_jill-macbook/peer_jill-macbook.png . In this case: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the Raspberry Pi that is running WireGuard.

Treat your .png files as \"sensitive documents\".","title":"Step 7: Save your WireGuard client configuration files (QR codes)"},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#routerNATConfig","text":"A typical home network will have a firewall that effectively blocks all incoming attempts from the Internet to open a new connection with a device on your network. To use a VPN from outside of your home network (which is precisely the point of running the service!), you need to configure your router to allow incoming WireGuard traffic to reach the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. These instructions assume you have the privileges to do that. If you have not used your router's administrative interface before, the default login credentials may be physically printed on the device or in its instruction manual. If you have never changed the default login credentials, you should take the time to do that. Routers have wildly different user interfaces but the concepts will be the same. This section describes the basic technique but if you are unsure how to do this on your particular router model, the best idea would be to search the web for: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] port forwarding configuration\"; or \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] NAT configuration\" A typical configuration process goes something like this: The router sub-process you need to configure is called Network Address Translation (NAT) but it's not unheard of for this functionality to be grouped with FireWall. The NAT component you are looking for probably has a name like \"Port Redirection\", \"Port Forwarding\", \"NAT Forwarding\" or \"NAT Virtual Server\". It might also be under \"Open Ports\" but those are usually one-to-one mappings (ie incomingPort=outgoingPort), apply to port ranges, and are intended to target a single DMZ host. The configuration screen will contain at least the following fields: Field Value Interface router's WAN interface Private IP x.x.x.x Private Port \u00abexternal\u00bb Protocol UDP Public Port \u00abpublic\u00bb Service Name WireGuard The fields in the above list are in alphabetical order. They will almost certainly be in a different order in your router and may also have different names: Interface is typically a popup menu. Generally it will either default to the name of the physical port on your router that connects to the outside world, or be some other sensible default like \"All\". Private IP (or Internal IP ) is the IP address of the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. Note that this pretty much forces you to give your Raspberry Pi a statically-configured IP address (either a static binding in your DHCP server or a hard-coded address in the Raspberry Pi itself). Private Port (or Internal Port ) needs to be the value you chose for \u00abexternal\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Yes, this does sound counterintuitive but it's a matter of perspective. From the router's perspective, the port is on the private or internal part of your home network. From Docker's perspective, the port is \u00abexternal\u00bb to container-space. Protocol will usually default to \"TCP\" but you must change it to \"UDP\". Public Port or External Port needs to be the value you chose for \u00abpublic\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Service Name (or Service Type ) is typically a text field, an editable menu (where you can either make a choice or type your own value), or a button approximating an editable menu. If you are given the option of choosing \"WireGuard\", do that, otherwise just type that name into the field. It has no significance other than reminding you what the rule is for.","title":"Step 8: Configure your router with a NAT rule"},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#configureClients","text":"This is a massive topic and one which is well beyond the scope of this guide. You really will have to work it out for yourself. Start by Googling: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] install WireGuard client\". You will find the list of client software at WireGuard Installation .

The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is 51720. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is 51820. You also need to make a few assumptions: The host running the remote WireGuard client (eg a mobile phone with the WireGuard app installed) has been allocated the IP address 55.66.77.88 when it connected to the Internet over 3G/4G/5G. When the remote WireGuard client initiated the session, it chose UDP port 44524 as its source port. The actual number chosen is (essentially) random and only significant to the client. Your Internet Service Provider allocated the IP address 12.13.14.15 to the WAN side of your router. You have done all the steps in Set up a Dynamic DNS name and your WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) is being propagated to your Dynamic DNS service provider. Here's a reference model to help explain what occurs: The remote WireGuard client: Obtains the Dynamic DNS domain name (\"downunda.duckdns.org\") and \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) from the configuration contained within the QR code. Recall that those values are obtained from the SERVERURL= and SERVERPORT= environment variables in docker-compose.yml . Executes a DNS query for the domain name \"downunda.duckdns.org\" to obtains the WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) of your home router. Addresses outgoing packets to 12.13.14.15:51620. You configure a NAT port-forwarding rule in your router which accepts incoming traffic on the \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) and uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the Raspberry Pi and destination port to the \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port (51720). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 192.168.203.60:51720. Docker is listening to the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port 51720. Docker uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the WireGuard container and destination port to the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 172.18.0.6:51820. The packet is then routed to the internal bridged network, and delivered to the WireGuard server process running in the container which is listening on the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). A reciprocal process occurs when the WireGuard server process sends packets back to the remote WireGuard client. The following table summarises the transformations as the client and server exchange information: Even if you use port 51820 everywhere (the default), all this Network Address Translation still occurs. Keep this in mind if you are trying to debug WireGuard because you may actually find it simpler to understand what is going on if you use different numbers for the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports. This model is a slight simplification because the remote client may also be also operating behind a router performing Network Address Translation.

Connect to the web front end and start adding your Zigbee devices. Prepare your Zigbee adapter \u00b6 Zigbee adapters usually need to be \"flashed\" before they can be used by Zigbee2MQTT. To prepare your adatper: Go to the supported adapters page. Find your adapter in the list. Follow the instructions for flashing your adapter. Note: If you can't find your adapter in the list of supported devices, you may not be able to get the Zigbee2MQTT container to connect to it. This kind of problem is outside the scope of IOTstack. You will have to raise the issue with the Zigbee2MQTT project. Identify your Zigbee adapter \u00b6 This section covers adapters that connect to your Raspberry Pi via USB. See connect to a remote adapter for information on connecting to adapters via TCP. Many USB Zigbee adapters mount as /dev/ttyACM0 but this is not true for all adapters. In addition, if you have multiple devices connected to your Raspberry Pi that contend for a given device name, there are no guarantees that your Zigbee adapter will always be assigned the same name each time the device list is enumerated. For those reasons, it is better to take the time to identify your Zigbee adapter in a manner that will be predictable, unique and reliable: If your Zigbee adapter is connected to your Raspberry Pi, disconnect it. Run the following command (the option is the digit \"1\"): $ ls -1 /dev/serial/by-id The possible response patterns are: An error message: ls: cannot access '/dev/serial/by-id': No such file or directory A list of one or more lines where your Zigbee adapter is not present. Example: usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_f068b8e7e82d4b119c0ee71fa1143ea0-if00-port0 The actual response (error, or a list of devices) does not matter. You are simply establishing a baseline. Connect your prepared Zigbee adapter to a USB port on your Raspberry Pi. Repeat the same ls command from step 2. The response pattern should be different from step 2. The list should now contain your Zigbee adapter. Example: usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_f068b8e7e82d4b119c0ee71fa1143ea0-if00-port0 usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00125A00183F06C5-if00 The second line indicates a CC2531 adapter is attached to the Raspberry Pi. If the response pattern does not change, it means the Raspberry Pi is unable to see your adapter. The two most common reasons are: Your adapter was not flashed correctly. Start over at prepare your Zigbee adapter . Your adapter does not mount as a serial device. Try repeating steps 2 through 4 with the command: $ ls -1 /dev to see if you can discover how your adapter attaches to your Raspberry Pi. One example is the Electrolama zig-a-zig-ah which attaches as /dev/ttyUSB0 . Use the output from the ls command in step 4 to form the absolute path to your Zigbee adapter. Example: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00125A00183F06C5-if00 Check your work like this (the option is the lower-case letter \"l\"): $ ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00125A00183F06C5-if00 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Mar 31 19:49 dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00125A00183F06C5-if00 -> ../../ttyACM0 What the output is telling you is that the by-id path is a symbolic link to /dev/ttyACM0 . Although this may always be true on your Raspberry Pi, the only part that is actually guaranteed to be true is the by-id path, which is why you should use it. Use your favourite text editor to open your compose file . Find your zigbee2mqtt service definition and identify this line: - /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 The default from the IOTstack template maps the external (Raspberry Pi) device /dev/ttyAMA0 to the internal (Zigbee2MQTT container) device /dev/ttyACM0 . On the Raspberry Pi, the external device /dev/ttyAMA0 is the Bluetooth adapter. It was chosen as the default because it normally exists and its presence avoids sending Zigbee2MQTT into a restart loop if you start the container before completing these steps. Replace /dev/ttyAMA0 with your by-id path. Example: - /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00125A00183F06C5-if00:/dev/ttyACM0 Save your work. Continue from bring up your stack . Configuration \u00b6 Environment variables \u00b6 Any value that can be set in a Zigbee2MQTT configuration file can also be set using an environment variable. The Zigbee2MQTT documentation explains the syntax. Note: Do not use quote marks to enclose the values (right hand sides) of environment variables. Whenever you change the value of an environment variable, you also need to tell docker-compose to apply the change: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d zigbee2mqtt The default service definition provided with IOTstack includes the following environment variables: TZ=Etc/UTC You should replace Etc/UTC with a value that is correct for your location. ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_MQTT_SERVER=mqtt://mosquitto:1883 { #mqttServer } Typical values for this are: mqtt://mosquitto:1883 This is default value supplied with the IOTstack template. It assumes that both Zigbee2MQTT and the Mosquitto broker are running in non-host mode containers on the same Raspberry Pi. mqtt://localhost:1883 This would be appropriate if you were to run Zigbee2MQTT in host mode and the Mosquitto broker was running on the same Raspberry Pi. mqtt://\u00abhost-or-ip\u00bb:1883 If the Mosquitto broker is running on a different computer, replace \u00abhost-or-ip\u00bb with the IP address or domain name of that other computer. You should also remove or comment-out the following lines from the service definition: depends_on : - mosquitto The depends_on clause ensures that the Mosquitto container starts alongside the Zigbee2MQTT container. That would not be appropriate if Mosquitto was running on a separate computer. ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_FRONTEND=true { #frontEndEnable } This variable activates the Zigbee2MQTT web interface on port 8080. If you want to change the port number where you access the Zigbee2MQTT web interface, see connecting to the web GUI . ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_ADVANCED_LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true { #logSymlink } Defining this variable causes Zigbee2MQTT to create a symlink pointing to the current log folder at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/log/current See Checking the log for more information about why this is useful. Configuration file \u00b6 Zigbee2MQTT creates a default configuration file at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml Although you can edit the configuration file, the approach recommended for IOTstack is to use environment variables . If you decide to edit the configuration file: You will need to use sudo to edit the file. After you have finished making changes, you need to inform the running container by: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart zigbee2mqtt Check the log for errors. Note: If you start Zigbee2MQTT from a clean slate (ie where the configuration file does not exist) and your compose file does not define the \u2026 MQTT_SERVER environment variable discussed above, the container will go into a restart loop. This happens because the Zigbee2MQTT container defaults to trying to reach the Mosquitto broker at localhost:1883 instead of mosquitto:1883 . That usually fails. Verifying basic operation \u00b6 Checking status \u00b6 $ docker ps | grep -e mosquitto -e zigbee2mqtt NAMES CREATED STATUS zigbee2mqtt 33 seconds ago Up 30 seconds mosquitto 33 seconds ago Up 31 seconds (healthy) The above output is filtered down to the relevant columns You are looking for evidence that the container is restarting (ie the \"Status\" column only ever shows a low number of seconds when compared with the \"Created\" column). Checking the log \u00b6 You can't use docker logs zigbee2mqtt to inspect the Zigbee2MQTT container's logs. That's because Zigbee2MQTT writes its logging information to the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/log/yyyy-mm-dd.hh-mm-ss/log.txt where yyyy-mm-dd.hh-mm-ss is the date and time the container was last started. This means that you have to identify the folder with the latest timestamp before you can inspect the log contained within it. Fortunately, Zigbee2MQTT offers a shortcut. If the \u2026 LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT environment variable is true then the path to the current log will be: ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/log/current/log.txt You can use commands like cat and tail to examine the current log. Example: $ cat ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/log/current/log.txt Checking Mosquitto connectivity \u00b6 To perform this check, you will need to have the Mosquitto clients installed: $ sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients The Mosquitto clients package includes two command-line tools: mosquitto_pub for publishing MQTT messages to the broker; and mosquitto_sub for subscribing to MQTT messages distributed by the broker. In IOTstack, the \"broker\" is usually the Mosquitto container. Assuming the Mosquitto clients are installed, you can run the following command: $ mosquitto_sub -v -h \"localhost\" -t \"zigbee2mqtt/#\" -F \"%I %t %p\" One of two things will happen: silence, indicating that the Zigbee2MQTT container is not able to communicate with the Mosquitto container. If this happens, you should check the Zigbee2MQTT log . chatter, proving that the Zigbee2MQTT container can communicate with the Mosquitto container. Terminate the mosquitto_sub command with a Control c . Connecting to the web GUI \u00b6 Open a browser, and point it to port 8080 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:8080 You should see the Zigbee2MQTT interface. Notes: The availability of the Zigbee2MQTT UI is governed by an environment variable. If you do not see the UI, check that \u2026 FRONTEND is defined. In the URL above, port 8080 is an external port which is exposed via the following port mapping in the Zigbee2MQTT service definition: ports : - \"8080:8080\" If you want to reach the Zigbee2MQTT UI via a different port, you should edit the left hand side of that mapping. For example, if you wanted to use port 10080 you would write: ports : - \"10080:8080\" Do not change the internal port number on the right hand side of the mapping. To apply changes to the port mapping: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d zigbee2mqtt Shell access to the container \u00b6 To open a shell inside the Zigbee2MQTT container, run: $ docker exec -it zigbee2mqtt ash ash is not a typo! To close the shell and leave the container, either type \"exit\" and press return , or press Control d . Container maintenance \u00b6 When you become aware of a new version of Zigbee2MQTT on DockerHub , do the following: $ cd ~IOTstack $ docker-compose pull zigbee2mqtt $ docker-compose up -d zigbee2mqtt $ docker system prune In words: Be in the correct directory. The pull compares the version on your Raspberry Pi with the latest version on DockerHub , and downloads any later version. If a newer version is downloaded, the up instantiates a new container based on the new image and performs a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime. The prune cleans up the older image. You can omit the zigbee2mqtt arguments from the pull and up commands, in which case docker-compose makes an attempt to pull any available updates for all non-Dockerfile-based images, and then instantiates any new images it has downloaded. Service definition change \u00b6 This information is for existing users of the Zigbee2MQTT container. The default IOTstack service definition for Zigbee2MQTT has changed: The container no longer needs to be built using a Dockerfile. The Zigbee2MQTT images on DockerHub can be used \"as is\". Environment variables supplied with the updated service definition exactly replicate the purpose of the old Dockerfile. The Dockerfile supplied with the IOTstack template is deprecated but continues to be provided to maintain backwards compatibility and to avoid introducing a breaking change. If you were using the Zigbee2MQTT container in IOTstack before April 2022, you should use your favourite text editor to update your compose file to conform with the new service definition. You could run the menu, then de-select and re-select Zigbee2MQTT. That will have the effect of applying the updated service definition but it also risks overwriting any other customisations you may have in place. That is why editing your compose file is the recommended approach. The updated service definition is included here for ease of reference: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 zigbee2mqtt : container_name : zigbee2mqtt image : koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest environment : - TZ=Etc/UTC - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_MQTT_SERVER=mqtt://mosquitto:1883 - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_FRONTEND=true - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_ADVANCED_LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true ports : - \"8080:8080\" volumes : - ./volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data:/app/data devices : - /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 restart : unless-stopped depends_on : - mosquitto The changes you should make to your existing Zigbee2MQTT service definition are: Replace the build directive: build : ./.templates/zigbee2mqtt/. with this image directive: image : koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest This causes IOTstack to use Zigbee2MQTT images \"as is\" from DockerHub . Add these environment variables: - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_MQTT_SERVER=mqtt://mosquitto:1883 - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_FRONTEND=true - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_ADVANCED_LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true The first two have the identical effect to the changes previously made via the Dockerfile. The last variable makes it easier for you to find and view the current log . See environment variables for more detail. Add the dependency clause: depends_on : - mosquitto This ensures the Mosquitto container is brought up alongside Zigbee2MQTT. The Zigbee2MQTT container goes into a restart loop if Mosquitto is not reachable so this change enforces that business rule. See \u2026 MQTT_SERVER for the situation where this might not be appropriate. pre-existing configuration file \u00b6 Environment variables in your compose file override corresponding values set in the configuration file at: ~/IOTstack/volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml If you have customised your existing Zigbee2MQTT configuration file , you should review your settings for potential conflicts with the environment variables introduced by the changes to the IOTstack service definition. You can resolve any conflicts either by: removing or commenting-out conflicting environment variables; or altering the environment variable values to match your configuration file. The second approach is recommended because it minimises the risk that Zigbee2MQTT will go into a restart loop if the configuration file is not present when the container starts. As the Zigbee2MQTT documentation explains, any option that can be set in a configuration file can also be set using an environment variable, so you may want to take the opportunity to implement all your settings as environment variables.","title":"Zigbee2MQTT"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#zigbee2mqtt","text":"","title":"Zigbee2MQTT"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#quick-links","text":"New users: start here Existing users: Service definition change (circa April 2022)","title":"Quick links"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#references","text":"Web Guide Supported adapters GitHub DockerHub","title":"References"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#definitions","text":"\"compose file\" means the file at the path: ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#basicProcess","text":"Run the IOTstack menu and choose both \"Mosquitto\" and \"Zigbee2MQTT\".

For example, if you wanted to use port 10080 you would write: ports : - \"10080:8080\" Do not change the internal port number on the right hand side of the mapping.

If a newer version is downloaded, the up instantiates a new container based on the new image and performs a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime. The prune cleans up the older image. You can omit the zigbee2mqtt arguments from the pull and up commands, in which case docker-compose makes an attempt to pull any available updates for all non-Dockerfile-based images, and then instantiates any new images it has downloaded.","title":"Container maintenance"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2MQTT/#update202204","text":"This information is for existing users of the Zigbee2MQTT container. The default IOTstack service definition for Zigbee2MQTT has changed: The container no longer needs to be built using a Dockerfile. The Zigbee2MQTT images on DockerHub can be used \"as is\". Environment variables supplied with the updated service definition exactly replicate the purpose of the old Dockerfile. The Dockerfile supplied with the IOTstack template is deprecated but continues to be provided to maintain backwards compatibility and to avoid introducing a breaking change. If you were using the Zigbee2MQTT container in IOTstack before April 2022, you should use your favourite text editor to update your compose file to conform with the new service definition. You could run the menu, then de-select and re-select Zigbee2MQTT. That will have the effect of applying the updated service definition but it also risks overwriting any other customisations you may have in place. That is why editing your compose file is the recommended approach. The updated service definition is included here for ease of reference: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 zigbee2mqtt : container_name : zigbee2mqtt image : koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest environment : - TZ=Etc/UTC - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_MQTT_SERVER=mqtt://mosquitto:1883 - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_FRONTEND=true - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_ADVANCED_LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true ports : - \"8080:8080\" volumes : - ./volumes/zigbee2mqtt/data:/app/data devices : - /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 restart : unless-stopped depends_on : - mosquitto The changes you should make to your existing Zigbee2MQTT service definition are: Replace the build directive: build : ./.templates/zigbee2mqtt/. with this image directive: image : koenkk/zigbee2mqtt:latest This causes IOTstack to use Zigbee2MQTT images \"as is\" from DockerHub . Add these environment variables: - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_MQTT_SERVER=mqtt://mosquitto:1883 - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_FRONTEND=true - ZIGBEE2MQTT_CONFIG_ADVANCED_LOG_SYMLINK_CURRENT=true The first two have the identical effect to the changes previously made via the Dockerfile. The last variable makes it easier for you to find and view the current log . See environment variables for more detail. Add the dependency clause: depends_on : - mosquitto This ensures the Mosquitto container is brought up alongside Zigbee2MQTT. The Zigbee2MQTT container goes into a restart loop if Mosquitto is not reachable so this change enforces that business rule.

You can resolve any conflicts either by: removing or commenting-out conflicting environment variables; or altering the environment variable values to match your configuration file. The second approach is recommended because it minimises the risk that Zigbee2MQTT will go into a restart loop if the configuration file is not present when the container starts. As the Zigbee2MQTT documentation explains, any option that can be set in a configuration file can also be set using an environment variable, so you may want to take the opportunity to implement all your settings as environment variables.","title":"pre-existing configuration file"},{"location":"Containers/Zigbee2mqttassistant/","text":"Zigbee2Mqtt Assistant \u00b6 References \u00b6 Docker Website About \u00b6 This service a web frontend which displays Zigbee2Mqtt service messages and able to control it over MQTT.

Links: Default configs Password configuration for Services Build Stack Menu System Coding a new service IOTstack issues","title":"Follow up"},{"location":"Developers/BuildStack-RandomPassword/","text":"Build Stack Random Services Password \u00b6 This page explains how to have a service generate a random password during build time. This will require that your service have a working options menu. Keep in mind that updating strings in a service's yaml config isn't limited to passwords. A word of caution \u00b6 Many services often set a password on their initial spin up and store it internally. That means if if the password is changed by the menu afterwards, it may not be reflected in the service. By default the password specified in the documentation should be used, unless the user specifically selected to use a randomly generated one. In the future, the feature to specify a password manually may be added in, much like how ports can be customised. A basic example \u00b6 Inside the service's service.yml file, a special string can be added in for the build script to find and replace. Commonly the string is %randomPassword% , but technically any string can be used. The same string can be used multiple times for the same password to be used multiple times, and/or multiple difference strings can be used for multiple passwords. mariadb : image : linuxserver/mariadb container_name : mariadb environment : - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=%randomAdminPassword% - MYSQL_DATABASE=default - MYSQL_USER=mariadbuser - MYSQL_PASSWORD=%randomPassword% These strings will be updated during the Prebuild Hook stage when building. The code to make this happen is shown below. Code commonly used to update passwords \u00b6 This code can basically be copy-pasted into your service's build.py file.

Background \u00b6 Originally this script was written in bash. After a while it became obvious that bash wasn't well suited to dealing with all the different types of configuration files, and logic that goes with configuring everything. IOTstack needs to be accessible to all levels of programmers and tinkerers, not just ones experienced with Linux and bash. For this reason, it was rewritten in Python since the language syntax is easier to understand, and is more commonly used for scripting and programming than bash. Bash is still used in IOTstack where it makes sense to use it, but the menu system itself uses Python. The code it self while not being the most well structured or efficient, was intentionally made that way so that beginners and experienced programmers could contribute to the project. We are always open to improvements if you have suggestions. Menu Structure \u00b6 Each screen of the menu is its own Python script. You can find most of these in the ./scripts directory. When you select an item from the menu, and it changes screens, it actually dynamically loads and executes that Python script. It passes data as required by placing it into the global variable space so that both the child and the parent script can access it. Injecting and getting globals in a child script \u00b6 with open(childPythonScriptPath, \"rb\") as pythonDynamicImportFile: code = compile(pythonDynamicImportFile.read(), childPythonScriptPath, \"exec\") execGlobals = { \"globalKeyName\": \"globalKeyValue\" } execLocals = {} print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'globalKeyValue' exec(code, execGlobals, execLocals) print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'newValue' Reading and writing global variables in a child script \u00b6 def someFunction: global globalKeyName print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'globalKeyValue' globalKeyName = \"newValue\" Each menu is its own python executable. The entry point is down the bottom of the file wrapped in a main() function to prevent variable scope creep. The code at the bottom of the main() function: if __name__ == 'builtins': Is actually where the execution path runs, all the code above it is just declared so that it can be called without ordering or scope issues. Optimisations \u00b6 It was obvious early on that the menu system would be slow on lower end devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, especially if it were rending a 4k terminal screen from a desktop via SSH. To mitigate this issue, not all of the screen is redrawn when there is a change. A \"Hotzone\" as it's called in the code, is usually rerendered when there's a change (such as pressing up or down to change an item selection, but not when scrolling). Full screen redraws are expensive and are only used when required, for example, when scrolling the pagination, selecting or deselecting a service, expanding or collapsing the menu and so on. Environments and encoding \u00b6 At the very beginning of the main menu screen ( ./scripts/main_menu.py ) the function checkRenderOptions() is run to determine what characters can be displayed on the screen. It will try various character sets, and eventually default to ASCII if none of the fancier stuff can be rendered. This setting is passed into of the sub menus through the submenu's global variables so that they don't have to recheck when they load. Sub-Menus \u00b6 From the main screen, you will see several sections leading to various submenus. Most of these menus work in the same way as the main menu. The only exception to this rule is the Build Stack menu, which is probably the most complex part of IOTstack. Build Stack Menu \u00b6 Path: ./scripts/buildstack_menu.py Loading \u00b6 Upon loading, the Build Stack menu will get a list of folders inside the ./templates directory and check for a build.py file inside each of them. This can be seen in the generateTemplateList() function, which is executed before the first rendering happens. The menu will then check if the file ./services/docker-compose.save.yml exists. This file is used to save the configuration of the last build. This happens in the loadCurrentConfigs() function. It is important that the service name in the compose file matches the folder name, any service that doesn't will either cause an error, or won't be loaded into the menu. If a previous build did exist the menu will then run the prepareMenuState() function that basically checks which items should be ticked, and check for any issues with the ticked items by running checkForIssues() . Selection and deselection \u00b6 When an item is selected, 3 things happen: 1. Update the UI variable ( menu ) with function checkMenuItem(selectionIndex) to let the user know the current state. 2. Update the array holding every checked item setCheckedMenuItems() . It uses the UI variable ( menu ) to know which items are set. 3. Check for any issues with the new list of selected items by running checkForIssues() . Check for options (submenus of services) \u00b6 During a full render sequence (this is not a hotzone render), the build stack menu checks to see if each of the services has an options menu. It does this by executing the build.py script of each of the services and passing in checkForOptionsHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a runOptionsMenu function. If the service's function result is true, without error, then the options text will appear up for that menu item. Check for issues \u00b6 When a service is selected or deselected on the menu, the checkForIssues() function is run. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForRunChecksHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a runChecks function. The runChecks function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Generally though, the runChecks function should check for conflicting port conflicts again any of the other services that are enabled. The menu will still allow you to build the stack, even if issues are present, assumine there's no errors raised during the build process. Prebuild hook \u00b6 Pressing enter on the Build Stack menu kicks off the build process. The Build Stack menu will execute the runPrebuildHook() function. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForPreBuildHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a preBuild function. The preBuild function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Some services may not even use the prebuild hook. The prebuild is very useful for setting up the services' configuration however. For example, it can be used to autogenerate a password for a paticular service, or copy and modify a configuration file from the ./.templates directory into the ./services or ./volumes directory. Postbuild hook \u00b6 The Build Stack menu will execute the runPostBuildHook() function in the final step of the build process, after the docker-compose.yml file has been written to disk. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForPostBuildHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a postBuild function. The postBuild function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Most services won't require this function, but it can be useful for cleaning up temporary files and so on. The build process \u00b6 The selected services' yaml configuration is already loaded into memory before the build stack process is started. Run prebuildHooks. Read ./.templates/docker-compose-base.yml file into a in memory yaml structure. Add selected services into the in memory structure. If it exists merge the ./compose-override.yml file into memory Write the in memory yaml structure to disk ./docker-compose.yml . Run postbuildHooks. Run postbuild.sh if it exists, with the list of services built.","title":"Menu system"},{"location":"Developers/Menu-System/#menu-system","text":"This page explains how the menu system works for developers.","title":"Menu system"},{"location":"Developers/Menu-System/#background","text":"Originally this script was written in bash.

Recreating a container using an old image is tricky. The local Docker image cache can't easily be restored to the same state with old images and old tag references. The docker pull will fetch the latest images, but it's not unheard of that the latest image may break something . Thus to guarantee a successful rollback to the pre-update state, you have to shutdown your RPi and save a complete disk image backup of its storage using another machine. For a hobby project, not having a perfect rollback may be a risk you're willing to take. Usually image problems will have fixes/workarounds within a day. Update Raspberry Pi OS \u00b6 You should keep your Raspberry Pi up-to-date. Despite the word \"container\" suggesting that containers are fully self-contained, they sometimes depend on operating system components (WireGuard is an example). $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y Recommended: Update only Docker images \u00b6 When you built the stack using the menu, it created the Docker Compose file docker-compose.yml . This file and any used build instructions ( Dockerfile s), use image name and tag references to images on hub.docker.com or other registries. An undefined tag defaults to :latest . When Docker is told to pull updated images, it will download the images into the local cache, based upon what is currently stored at the registry for the used names and tags. Updating the IOTstack project templates and recreating your docker-compose.yml isn't usually necessary. Doing so isn't likely to provide much benefits, and may actually break something. A full update is only recommended when there is a new feature or change you need.

Migrating to SensorsIot/IOTstack was fairly easy when this repository was first forked from gcgarner/IOTstack. Unfortunately, what was a fairly simple switching procedure no longer works properly because conflicts have emerged. The probability of conflicts developing increases as a function of time since the fork. Conflicts were and are pretty much inevitable so a more involved procedure is needed. Migration Steps \u00b6 Step 1 \u2013 Check your assumptions \u00b6 Make sure that you are, actually , on gcgarner. Don't assume! $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/gcgarner/IOTstack.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/gcgarner/IOTstack.git (push) Do not proceed if you don't see those URLs! Step 2 \u2013 Take IOTstack down \u00b6 Take your stack down. This is not strictly necessary but we'll be moving the goalposts a bit so it's better to be on the safe side. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down Step 3 \u2013 Choose your migration method \u00b6 There are two basic approaches to switching from gcgarner/IOTstack to SensorsIot/IOTstack: Migration by changing upstream repository Migration by clone and merge You can think of the first as \"working with git\" while the second is \"using brute force\". The first approach will work if you haven't tried any other migration steps and/or have not made too many changes to items in your gcgarner/IOTstack that are under git control. If you are already stuck or you try the first approach and get a mess, or it all looks far too hard to sort out, then try the Migration by clone and merge approach. Migration Option 1 \u2013 change upstream repository \u00b6 Check for local changes \u00b6 Make sure you are on the master branch (you probably are so this is just a precaution), and then see if Git thinks you have made any local changes: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git checkout master $ git status If Git reports any \"modified\" files, those will probably get in the way of a successful migration so it's a good idea to get those out of the way. For example, suppose you edited menu.sh at some point. Git would report that as: modified: menu.sh The simplest way to deal with modified files is to rename them to move them out of the way, and then restore the original: Rename your customised version by adding your initials to the end of the filename. Later, you can come back and compare your customised version with the version from GitHub and see if you want to preserve any changes. Here I'm assuming your initials are \"jqh\": $ mv menu.sh menu.sh.jqh Tell git to restore the unmodified version: $ git checkout -- menu.sh Now, repeat the Git command that complained about the file: $ git status The modified file will show up as \"untracked\" which is OK (ignore it) Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) menu.sh.jqh Synchronise with gcgarner on GitHub \u00b6 Make sure your local copy of gcgarner is in sync with GitHub. $ git pull Get rid of any upstream reference \u00b6 There may or may not be any \"upstream\" set. The most likely reason for this to happen is if you used your local copy as the basis of a Pull Request. The next command will probably return an error, which you should ignore. It's just a precaution. $ git remote remove upstream Point to SensorsIot \u00b6 Change your local repository to point to SensorsIot. $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git Synchronise with SensorsIot on GitHub \u00b6 This is where things can get a bit tricky so please read these instructions carefully before you proceed. When you run the next command, it will probably give you a small fright by opening a text-editor window. Don't panic - just keep reading. Now, run this command: $ git pull -X theirs origin master The text editor window will look something like this: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit. The first line is a pre-prepared commit message, the remainder is boilerplate instructions which you can ignore. Exactly which text editor opens is a function of your EDITOR environment variable and the core.editor set in your global Git configuration. If you: remember changing EDITOR and/or core.editor then, presumably, you will know how to interact with your chosen text editor. You don't need to make any changes to this file. All you need to do is save the file and exit; don't remember changing either EDITOR or core.editor then the editor will probably be the default vi (aka vim ). You need to type \":wq\" (without the quotes) and then press return. The \":\" puts vi into command mode, the \"w\" says \"save the file\" and \"q\" means \"quit vi \". Pressing return runs the commands. Git will display a long list of stuff. It's very tempting to ignore it but it's a good idea to take a closer look, particularly for signs of error or any lines beginning with: Auto-merging At the time of writing, you can expect Git to mention these two files: Auto-merging menu.sh Auto-merging .templates/zigbee2mqtt/service.yml Those are known issues and the merge strategy -X theirs on the git pull command you have just executed deals with both, correctly, by preferring the SensorsIot version. Similar conflicts may emerge in future and those will probably be dealt with, correctly, by the same merge strategy. Nevertheless, you should still check the output very carefully for other signs of merge conflict so that you can at least be alive to the possibility that the affected files may warrant closer inspection. For example, suppose you saw: Auto-merging .templates/someRandomService/service.yml If you don't use someRandomService then you could safely ignore this on the basis that it was \"probably right\". However, if you did use that service and it started to misbehave after migration, you would know that the service.yml file was a good place to start looking for explanations. Finish with a pull \u00b6 At this point, only the migrated master branch is present on your local copy of the repository. The next command brings you fully in-sync with GitHub: $ git pull Migration Option 2 \u2013 clone and merge \u00b6 If you have been following the process correctly, your IOTstack will already be down. Rename your existing IOTstack folder \u00b6 Move your old IOTstack folder out of the way, like this: $ cd ~ $ mv IOTstack IOTstack.old Note: You should not need sudo for the mv command but it is OK to use it if necessary. Fetch a clean clone of SensorsIot/IOTstack \u00b6 $ git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack Explore the result: $ tree -aFL 1 --noreport ~/IOTstack /home/pi/IOTstack \u251c\u2500\u2500 .bash_aliases \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 .native/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .templates/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .tmp/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 duck/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 install.sh* \u251c\u2500\u2500 menu.sh* \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/ Note: If the tree command is not installed for some reason, use ls -A1F ~/IOTstack . Observe what is not there: There is no docker-compose.yml There is no backups directory There is no services directory There is no volumes directory From this, it should be self-evident that a clean checkout from GitHub is the factory for all IOTstack installations, while the contents of backups , services , volumes and docker-compose.yml represent each user's individual choices, configuration options and data. Merge old into new \u00b6 Execute the following commands: $ mv ~/IOTstack.old/docker-compose.yml ~/IOTstack $ mv ~/IOTstack.old/services ~/IOTstack $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/volumes ~/IOTstack You should not need to use sudo for the first two commands. However, if you get a permissions conflict on either, you should proceed like this: docker-compose.yml $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/docker-compose.yml ~/IOTstack $ sudo chown pi:pi ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml services $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/services ~/IOTstack $ sudo chown -R pi:pi ~/IOTstack/services There is no need to migrate the backups directory. You are better off creating it by hand: $ mkdir ~/IOTstack/backups Step 4 \u2013 Choose your menu \u00b6 If you have reached this point, you have migrated to SensorsIot/IOTstack where you are on the \"master\" branch. This implies \"new menu\". The choice of menu is entirely up to you. Differences include: New menu takes a lot more screen real-estate than old menu. If you do a fair bit of work on small screens (eg iPad) you might find it hard to work with new menu. New menu creates a large number of internal Docker networks whereas old menu has one internal network to rule them all . The practical consequence is that most users see error messages for networks being defined but not used, and occasionally run into problems where two containers can't talk to each other without tinkering with the networks. Neither of those happen under old menu. See Issue 245 if you want more information on this. New menu has moved the definition of environment variables into docker-compose.yml . Old menu keeps environment variables in \"environment files\" in ~/IOTstack/services . There is no \"right\" or \"better\" about either approach. It's just something to be aware of.

For example, suppose you edited menu.sh at some point. Git would report that as: modified: menu.sh The simplest way to deal with modified files is to rename them to move them out of the way, and then restore the original: Rename your customised version by adding your initials to the end of the filename.

When you run the next command, it will probably give you a small fright by opening a text-editor window. Don't panic - just keep reading. Now, run this command: $ git pull -X theirs origin master The text editor window will look something like this: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit. The first line is a pre-prepared commit message, the remainder is boilerplate instructions which you can ignore. Exactly which text editor opens is a function of your EDITOR environment variable and the core.editor set in your global Git configuration. If you: remember changing EDITOR and/or core.editor then, presumably, you will know how to interact with your chosen text editor. You don't need to make any changes to this file. All you need to do is save the file and exit; don't remember changing either EDITOR or core.editor then the editor will probably be the default vi (aka vim ). You need to type \":wq\" (without the quotes) and then press return. The \":\" puts vi into command mode, the \"w\" says \"save the file\" and \"q\" means \"quit vi \". Pressing return runs the commands. Git will display a long list of stuff. It's very tempting to ignore it but it's a good idea to take a closer look, particularly for signs of error or any lines beginning with: Auto-merging At the time of writing, you can expect Git to mention these two files: Auto-merging menu.sh Auto-merging .templates/zigbee2mqtt/service.yml Those are known issues and the merge strategy -X theirs on the git pull command you have just executed deals with both, correctly, by preferring the SensorsIot version. Similar conflicts may emerge in future and those will probably be dealt with, correctly, by the same merge strategy. Nevertheless, you should still check the output very carefully for other signs of merge conflict so that you can at least be alive to the possibility that the affected files may warrant closer inspection. For example, suppose you saw: Auto-merging .templates/someRandomService/service.yml If you don't use someRandomService then you could safely ignore this on the basis that it was \"probably right\". However, if you did use that service and it started to misbehave after migration, you would know that the service.yml file was a good place to start looking for explanations.","title":"Synchronise with SensorsIot on GitHub"},{"location":"Updates/gcgarner-migration/#finish-with-a-pull","text":"At this point, only the migrated master branch is present on your local copy of the repository.

This implies \"new menu\". The choice of menu is entirely up to you. Differences include: New menu takes a lot more screen real-estate than old menu. If you do a fair bit of work on small screens (eg iPad) you might find it hard to work with new menu. New menu creates a large number of internal Docker networks whereas old menu has one internal network to rule them all . The practical consequence is that most users see error messages for networks being defined but not used, and occasionally run into problems where two containers can't talk to each other without tinkering with the networks. Neither of those happen under old menu. See Issue 245 if you want more information on this. New menu has moved the definition of environment variables into docker-compose.yml . Old menu keeps environment variables in \"environment files\" in ~/IOTstack/services . There is no \"right\" or \"better\" about either approach. It's just something to be aware of. Under new menu, the service.yml files in ~/IOTstack/.templates have all been left-shifted by two spaces.
